[00:00:00] Jon Snow is a fantasy hero – he goes on adventures, falls in love,
[00:00:06] and fights to save the realm. As a bastard, Jon feels rejected, so he searches for family
[00:00:12] and identity. And he struggles to do the right thing in a morally complicated world.
[00:00:19] The first three seasons of the Game of Thrones TV show are a pretty close adaptation of the
[00:00:25] books. But in the later seasons, TV Jon is a very different character to book Jon.
[00:00:32] TV Jon is a badass warrior who fights lots of bad guys. He’s described as “brave” but “Stupid”,
[00:00:40] cause he takes dumb risks. He’s not good at politics because he’s so stubbornly honest. Actor
[00:00:46] Kit Harington says “Jon is not able to lie”. TV Jon only wants to do the right thing. He doesn’t
[00:00:54] want to be a king – he says “I never wanted it”. But in the books, Jon is different. Book Jon
[00:01:09] is not a great warrior – he’s more of a smart politician. Book Jon’s not always honest – he
[00:01:17] lies and has secret plans. And he doesn’t just wanna do the right thing. He’s also tempted by
[00:01:23] his desires for honour, revenge, love, and home. When he gets the chance to rule Winterfell,
[00:01:31] he wants it. He thinks “I have always wanted it”. Author George Martin writes about “the human
[00:01:40] heart in conflict with itself”. Book Jon is defined by internal conflict between
[00:01:46] his desires and his duty, forcing him to make tough choices. He constantly faces moral dilemmas
[00:01:53] that question what it means to be a hero. But in the later seasons of the TV show,
[00:01:58] Jon often has no internal conflict. When he just wants to do the right thing,
[00:02:03] his choices have no moral or emotional cost. And in the show, Jon’s big plot twists go
[00:02:11] nowhere. Like, Jon dies then comes back to life – but death doesn’t much change him, and his
[00:02:17] resurrection is barely mentioned again. Jon finds out he’s a Targaryen, heir to the throne – but Jon
[00:02:24] doesn’t want the throne, or to be a Targaryen, so this also doesn’t change him. Jon is set up
[00:02:30] as the prophesied hero who’ll defeat the white walkers, but in the end, Jon just shouts a dragon
[00:02:36] while his sister saves the world. After seasons of buildup, these twists and reveals feel pointless.
[00:02:44] In the books, Jon’s resurrection will transform him. His Targaryen blood has power. Jon is
[00:02:51] deeply connected with prophecy and magic that will change the world of ice and fire. Jon’s
[00:02:58] moral and emotional struggles explore the series’ central themes of power, family and heroism. And
[00:03:05] when Jon collides with Daenerys and Tyrion in the final books – George Martin says it’ll be a very
[00:03:11] different ending to the show. So who is the real Jon Snow in the books, and how will his story end?
[00:03:22] Jon Snow grew up at Winterfell with Lord Eddard Stark, Lady Catelyn, and their children Robb,
[00:03:27] Sansa, Arya, Bran, and Rickon. But Jon is different to the other kids because he’s a
[00:03:33] bastard – Jon is not Catelyn’s son, he’s the son of some other woman. And Ned won’t tell
[00:03:39] anyone who Jon’s mother is. Some say she was Lady Ashara Dayne, others say she was a commoner. The
[00:03:47] truth is probably that Jon is really the son of Ned’s sister, Lyanna Stark, with Prince Rhaegar
[00:03:53] Targaryen. Ned promised to protect Jon, so he pretends to be Jon’s father. That’s what was
[00:04:00] revealed in the TV show anyway, and there are lots of hints that this is true in the books as
[00:04:04] well. If Jon is Prince Rhaegar’s son, then Jon is arguably the rightful King of Westeros. But
[00:04:12] everyone thinks he’s Ned’s bastard, born outside marriage – so Jon has the bastard name Snow,
[00:04:19] not the trueborn family name Stark. Bastards have lower social status in Westeros, and are widely
[00:04:26] distrusted. So Jon faces prejudice and exclusion. Catelyn feels hurt that Ned cheated on her,
[00:04:34] and raised his bastard in their home. So Cat never accepts Jon – she’s cold to him,
[00:04:41] sometimes cruel, making Jon feel that he’s not part of the family. This is partly for political
[00:04:47] reasons – Catelyn wants to make sure that her son Robb inherits Winterfell, and she worries
[00:04:53] that Jon could be a political rival – so Catelyn makes it clear that Jon is not a true Stark.
[00:05:01] Jon even looks different to the Starks. In the books, Robb Sansa Bran and Rickon have auburn
[00:05:07] hair and blue eyes like their mother Catelyn. But Jon has dark brown hair, and dark grey eyes,
[00:05:14] like Ned. So Jon is the black sheep, who doesn’t fit in. The only kid who looks like Jon is Arya,
[00:05:22] and she’s also a misfit cause she’s a rebellious tomboy. So Jon and Arya are close – Jon musses her
[00:05:28] hair and calls her “little sister”. Robb is Jon’s “best friend” and rival. Jon is kind to Bran and
[00:05:36] to young Rickon. Though Sansa is distant with Jon – she calls him half-brother, not brother.
[00:05:44] So Jon loves the Starks, but because he’s the bastard, feels he’s not part of the family.
[00:05:51] In Book 1, Jon is a fourteen year old boy. He’s quiet, brooding, sometimes “sullen”,
[00:05:57] and hot-headed. But he’s empathetic and open-minded – willing to listen, learn, and grow.
[00:06:04] In Chapter 1, the Starks find five direwolf pups. Direwolves are mystical creatures,
[00:06:11] and the symbol of House Stark. Bran wants to keep the pups, so Jon convinces Ned that the
[00:06:16] five pups should belong to the five Stark kids. Jon excludes himself, says he doesn’t get a wolf,
[00:06:24] cause he’s a bastard – Jon sacrifices his own happiness out of kindness for Bran.
[00:06:30] But then, Jon hears a noise that no one else can hear, so he finds one more direwolf,
[00:06:36] apart from the others. It’s an albino with white fur and red eyes, who he names Ghost. So Ghost
[00:06:44] and Jon are both “different” and “apart” from their families. Ghost’s white fur and
[00:06:49] red eyes could be a hint of Jon’s real father Rhaegar, because Rhaegar also had pale hair,
[00:06:55] and wore Targaryen red. But it's strange how Jon finds Ghost. Cause Jon hears a “noise”,
[00:07:02] but we learn that Ghost is always silent, Ghost never makes a sound, so what noise did Jon hear?
[00:07:10] Maybe Jon was influenced by Bloodraven. Bloodraven, or the three-eyed crow,
[00:07:16] was once a Targaryen bastard politician. Now he’s a greenseer, a sorcerer with the magic of the old
[00:07:24] gods and the weirwood trees – Bloodraven teaches Bran magic later on. And throughout the books,
[00:07:29] Bloodraven manipulates events from afar, by giving people dreams, and by controlling animals with
[00:07:35] skinchanger or warg magic. Ghost is connected to this magic – Ghost’s white fur and red eyes look
[00:07:44] like the white and red weirwood trees – Jon thinks that Ghost “belongs to the old gods”
[00:07:50] Bloodraven also has white hair and a red eye. So maybe Bloodraven used the magic of the old
[00:07:57] gods to make Jon hear a noise, to make him find Ghost. Bloodraven might even sent the direwolves’
[00:08:04] mother south in the first place. Cause there are hints that Bloodraven has plans for Jon,
[00:08:10] wants to use him to fulfil prophecies to defeat the white walkers. So Ghost not only symbolises
[00:08:16] how Jon is different to his siblings, but also connects him to mysterious magic.
[00:08:23] King Robert comes to Winterfell, but at the feast, Catelyn seats Jon at the back of the hall,
[00:08:30] separate from the family. Jon feels he has no future at Winterfell. Robb will be the
[00:08:36] next Stark lord, his siblings will marry great houses and rule holdfasts. But as a bastard,
[00:08:42] Jon has no inheritance, no home here. So he tells his uncle Benjen that he wants to join
[00:08:49] the Night’s Watch. The Watch is an ancient brotherhood who guard the Wall in the north.
[00:08:54] Jon sees the Watch as his path to honour and adventure, a chance to prove his worth.
[00:09:01] Benjen warns Jon that Watch men serve for life. They swear to never marry or have kids,
[00:09:07] and to “hold no lands” and “wear no crowns” – Benjen says Jon doesn’t understand the “cost”
[00:09:14] of that oath. Some fans think that Benjen knows that Jon is the son of Prince Rhaegar, and that if
[00:09:21] Jon swears the Watch oath, he’d be giving up his claim to the Throne. Cause Benjen was at Harrenhal
[00:09:28] when Rhaegar and Lyanna’s relationship likely began. Benjen’s grief and guilt
[00:09:33] over Lyanna’s death might be why Benjen joined the Night’s Watch – but that’s just a theory.
[00:09:38] Jon feels rejected – he can’t join the Night’s Watch, he can’t be a Stark, so who is he?
[00:09:46] Jon and Arya watch Prince Joffrey and Robb training at swords. Jon and Arya both want
[00:09:52] to join in the training, but Jon’s not allowed cause he’s a bastard, and Arya’s not allowed
[00:09:57] cause she’s a girl. Jon says “Nothing is fair”. This world discriminates by social
[00:10:04] class and gender – it’s unfair that Joffrey gets more power and privilege, just cause he’s
[00:10:10] a prince and Jon’s a bastard. Which is ironic, because Joffrey is actually Jaime’s bastard,
[00:10:16] while Jon is secretly a prince. But the point is that Jon experiences injustice and prejudice,
[00:10:22] and that drives him to make justice later on. Ned is going south, and Catelyn wants Jon gone.
[00:10:30] So Ned agrees to send Jon to the Night’s Watch – though Ned’s voice is “troubled”.
[00:10:36] This chapter is from Catelyn’s point of view, so we don’t get to see Ned’s thoughts here.
[00:10:42] If Ned promised to protect Jon… why send Jon to the Wall? Maybe Ned thinks that Jon
[00:10:48] will be safer if he swears the Watch oath to wear no crowns – cause then Jon can’t
[00:10:53] be used in any dangerous political plots. Aemon Targaryen joined the Watch for similar reasons.
[00:11:00] So Jon is leaving Winterfell. He says goodbye to Bran. And Catelyn is cruel to Jon – she says
[00:11:07] she wishes Jon was in a coma instead of Bran. But Jon tells Robb that Cat was kind to him, so that
[00:11:13] Robb doesn’t feel bad – again, Jon sacrifices his own feelings for the happiness of others.
[00:11:20] Jon says goodbye to Arya, and gives her a sword called Needle. He tells Arya to learn to fight,
[00:11:26] in defiance of society’s sexist rules. And for the rest of the books, Jon and Arya
[00:11:32] think about each other often, hoping to reunite. The TV show adds a scene where Ned says goodbye.
[00:11:39] Jon asks about his mother, and Ned promises he’ll tell Jon the next time they meet. Evoking Ned’s
[00:11:46] promise to Lyanna. But tragically, Jon and Ned never see each other again. In the books,
[00:11:52] Jon dreams that his mother was beautiful and kind. He also knows she may have been a whore.
[00:11:59] He worries that Ned did something shameful with his mother – why else would Ned be so
[00:12:04] secretive? Jon is haunted by this painful mystery. Jon rides north with Benjen and Tyrion Lannister.
[00:12:13] And they’re joined by more recruits for the Watch. Jon is upset to learn the recruits are criminals,
[00:12:20] forced to join the Watch as a punishment. Jon had thought the Watch was a noble brotherhood of
[00:12:26] heroes – but Tyrion says it’s a dumping ground for outcasts. Robb will inherit Winterfell,
[00:12:33] while Jon is abandoned with the rejects. At first, Jon gets angry at Tyrion – Ghost attacks
[00:12:39] Tyrion – Jon has several emotional tantrums in the books – like other Targaryens, Jon has a temper.
[00:12:46] But then Jon cools down, and accepts that Tyrion is right. His life will be hard, it’s not what he
[00:12:54] hoped for. But growing up, becoming an adult, means making the best of an imperfect world.
[00:13:00] Tyrion tells Jon to be proud of his bastard identity – to use it as a
[00:13:07] strength. And Jon asks Tyrion to help Bran. The bastard and the dwarf form an unlikely
[00:13:10] friendship, which could be important in later books.
[00:13:14] Jon starts his new life at Castle Black, and it sucks. Jon wants adventure beyond the Wall,
[00:13:22] but he’s put into training, under the cruel Alliser Thorne – Alliser calls Jon “Lord Snow”,
[00:13:29] as a mocking nickname. Jon easily beats the other recruits at sword practice,
[00:13:34] cause Jon’s had proper training – so the boys hate Jon. Jon is cold and alone on the Wall,
[00:13:41] feeling sorry for himself, until the smith Donal Noye gives Jon advice. He says Jon is
[00:13:48] not the victim here – Jon may think his life sucks, but Jon grew up in a castle,
[00:13:54] the son of a great lord. Most Watch recruits are peasants who’ve suffered way more than Jon
[00:13:59] has. When Jon beats the other boys, he’s being a privileged arrogant bully. Jon listens to Donal,
[00:14:07] and starts to show empathy. He makes friends with Grenn and Pyp, and he teaches the recruits
[00:14:13] to fight better. Though Alliser gets angry at Jon for undermining his authority. When Jon
[00:14:20] stands up to Alliser, he makes a bitter, lasting enemy. It’s kinda ironic that Alliser hates Jon,
[00:14:28] ’cause in Robert’s Rebellion, Alliser fought for the Targaryens – and Jon is secretly a Targaryen.
[00:14:34] Samwell Tarly arrives. Sam is fat, and scared, and useless at fighting, so Alliser has Sam beaten.
[00:14:43] Jon has sympathy for misfits, like Tyrion and Arya and himself, so Jon protects Sam. Using persuasion
[00:14:51] and threats, Jon convinces all the recruits to not hurt Sam. So Jon becomes a leader, someone who
[00:14:58] brings people together to protect the vulnerable. Jon is frustrated by Sam’s weakness. But he
[00:15:05] listens and tries to understand Sam. Jon looks past Sam’s flaws, and sees his strengths – that
[00:15:12] Sam is smart and good with books. So Jon asks for Sam to become Maester Aemon’s steward, arguing
[00:15:19] that the world needs the unique talents of all different people. Jon makes change to empower the
[00:15:26] vulnerable. The TV show doesn’t include this bit. TV Jon is not as interested in change and justice,
[00:15:34] which makes him a more passive character. Book Jon has political values and a vision for change,
[00:15:41] which gives him a reason to want power. Jon graduates to become a full brother of
[00:15:47] the Watch. Jon wants to be a ranger, to patrol beyond the Wall. But he’s made a steward,
[00:15:54] a servant for Commander Jeor Mormont. At first, Jon is angry, says he’s too good to be a mere
[00:16:01] steward. But Sam says Jeor will teach Jon to lead, will groom him for command. So again Jon listens,
[00:16:09] puts aside his childish arrogance, and accepts his new responsibilities.
[00:16:15] Jon swears his Night’s Watch oath at a weirwood tree, sacred to the old gods – he feels connected
[00:16:21] to the gods of the Starks and the north. He swears to take no wife, no lands, no children,
[00:16:28] and no crowns, to be the sword in the dark, the fire against the cold, the light of the dawn,
[00:16:34] to guard the realms of men until his death. The Watch is a motley brotherhood of outcasts
[00:16:42] and underdogs. But it becomes Jon’s family. He still loves the Starks, but he was never
[00:16:49] one of them. The Night’s Watch are his brothers. The boys celebrate their graduation with snowball
[00:16:56] fights and childish horseplay – they’re so innocent, unprepared for the dangers
[00:17:01] to come. Alliser says that in winter, these boys will die like flies. Childhood will end,
[00:17:11] many will die. ’Cause “The cold winds are rising”, and “winter is coming”.
[00:17:18] Uncle Benjen is missing. He went beyond the Wall with six men, and hasn’t come back. Ghost finds
[00:17:25] two of Benjen’s men dead. Their bodies are pale, with blue eyes – so Jon fears they were killed by
[00:17:33] the Others, or white walkers, the legendary ice demons from beyond the Wall. Thousands of years
[00:17:40] ago, in the Long Night, the walkers attacked with an army of the dead. And now they are returning.
[00:17:47] In the night, Ghost leads Jon to find that one of the corpses has risen from the dead – it’s
[00:17:53] now a wight, a zombie controlled by the white walkers. So Jon bravely fights the wight,
[00:18:00] and kills it with fire. Jon’s hand gets burned in the fire – cause in the books, Targaryens can
[00:18:07] be burned, they’re not all fireproof. And for the rest of the story Jon flexes his
[00:18:12] scarred burned hand – a constant reminder of the white walker threat. It seems this wight
[00:18:19] was trying to kill Commander Jeor. Meanwhile, the other corpse rises and kills the acting
[00:18:25] First Ranger. So the white walkers are targeting high-ranking officers to weaken the Night’s Watch.
[00:18:31] It's interesting that Ghost leads Jon to the wights. Maybe Bloodraven is influencing Ghost,
[00:18:37] leading Jon to face the white walkers. Jon saved Jeor’s life – he proved himself. So
[00:18:45] Jeor gives Jon a sword called Longclaw. Longclaw is a bastard sword – which means it’s bigger
[00:18:51] than a normal one-handed sword. And Longclaw is Valyrian steel, a super sharp blade from Valyria,
[00:18:58] the ancient dragonlord empire – which subtly connects Jon to his Valyrian Targaryen ancestors.
[00:19:06] For centuries, Longclaw was held by Jeor’s family House Mormont, passed down from
[00:19:11] father to son. But Jeor’s son Jorah fled the country. So when Jeor gives the sword to Jon,
[00:19:18] he symbolically chooses Jon as his new son. Jon has mixed feelings about this. Jon had once
[00:19:26] dreamed that his father Ned would give him the Stark family sword. Jon is loyal to Jeor – and Jon
[00:19:33] is desperate for a father figure – but he doesn’t want to replace Ned. He feels torn between the
[00:19:40] Watch and the Starks – but he accepts the sword. And Longclaw gets a new pommel shaped like Ghost.
[00:19:48] In the south, Ned is imprisoned by King Joffrey, and Robb marches south to save him. Jon
[00:19:55] desperately wants to help the Starks – but he’s sworn to stay on the Wall. So what should he do?
[00:20:01] Maester Aemon says the reason why Watch men swear to have no family is “So they
[00:20:07] will not love”. Watch men should be focussed on defending the realm, and if they have families,
[00:20:12] that would divide their loyalties, and weaken the Watch. Aemon says love is “the death of duty”,
[00:20:20] so to do his duty, Jon must let go of his love for the Starks.
[00:20:26] Aemon has felt this pain himself, cause Aemon’s a Targaryen – he’s the great-granduncle of Daenerys
[00:20:32] and Rhaegar. And great-great-granduncle of Jon Snow. When the Targaryens were overthrown
[00:20:38] in Robert’s Rebellion, when his family was slaughtered, Aemon kept his oath on the Wall.
[00:20:45] So will Jon stay for his duty, or help the Starks out of love? Jon wants to do the right thing,
[00:20:52] but either choice feels like a betrayal. This is Jon’s first moral dilemma – a choice where there
[00:20:59] is no totally right answer, both options have a cost. So Jon has to compromise, make sacrifices,
[00:21:06] think hard about his values and morality. This is what Jon’s story is all about – exploring
[00:21:12] how to be a hero in a morally complex world. Later, the Lannisters execute Ned. They kill
[00:21:21] Jon’s only parent. So then Jon chooses love – he rides south to help Robb. Jon knows the
[00:21:29] punishment for leaving the Watch is death. So Jon decides he’ll be a fugitive – “friendless,
[00:21:35] and damned”. He only hopes to avenge his father in battle – so that Jon can die like a true Stark.
[00:21:44] Jon is as dramatic and naïve as Sansa, in Book 1 – fantasising of a glorious self-sacrifice.
[00:21:52] Jon rides south, but his friends go after him. They remind him of his duty to his
[00:21:58] Watch brothers, and bring him back to the Wall. Jeor tells Jon to grow up. There’s no point in
[00:22:05] Jon getting himself killed by deserting. Jon can’t bring Ned back to life, and Jon won’t
[00:22:10] make a difference in Robb’s army. The war in the south is not as important as the war in the
[00:22:16] north – cause beyond the Wall, wildlings are gathering, the walking dead are attacking the
[00:22:22] Watch – they are the enemies that matter. Jeor says Jon belongs on the Wall – because he has
[00:22:28] the blood of the Starks, with the magic of the old gods, and his direwolf. The Watch is his destiny.
[00:22:35] Jon reflects that he has “no rights, no name”, and now no parents. All he has is
[00:22:42] his Watch duty. Jon is “troubled” by his loves and loyalties, but decides he’ll keep his vows.
[00:22:52] At the start of Book 1, Jon is an immature boy, angry at the world for rejecting him. But
[00:22:59] Jon listens to Tyrion, Donal, Aemon, and Jeor. He extends his empathy to the outcasts of the Watch,
[00:23:07] and becomes a leader who defends the weak. A warrior who fights the dead. But being
[00:23:13] a hero is complicated. Jon is torn between his duty to the Watch and his love for the
[00:23:19] Starks – can he fight for the greater good and protect the people he loves?
[00:23:26] In Book 2, the Watch rides north. Jeor leads three hundred men beyond the Wall to find Benjen,
[00:23:33] to face the white walkers and to find the wildlings. Many wildling villages have recently
[00:23:39] been abandoned, so Jeor wants to find out where the wildlings went. They stop at a village called
[00:23:45] Whitetree, which has an enormous “monstrous” weirwood tree. The tree has a jagged mouth
[00:23:51] full of human bones, like a sacrifice to the old gods. The wildlings burn their dead so they don’t
[00:23:59] rise again as wights. Above, the mystical red comet burns, evoking ancient prophecy,
[00:24:06] foretelling change and doom. Book 2 has a growing sense of mystery and dark magic.
[00:24:14] Jon once dreamed of adventure beyond the Wall. But this adventure sucks. They ride through rain,
[00:24:22] Jon’s back hurts, the food’s bad – it’s no fun. He learns that real life is not like a fantasy
[00:24:29] story. Life is harder, and more complicated – sometimes good and evil are not as they seem.
[00:24:37] The rangers stop at Craster’s Keep. Craster is a wildling – and the son of a Night’s Watch man. And
[00:24:44] Craster marries his own daughters, has children of incest, and rules his daughter-wives with
[00:24:51] violence and fear. Craster even sacrifices his baby sons to the white walkers. So Craster is
[00:24:59] an evil man. But the Night’s Watch treat him as an ally – Craster gives them shelter and intel,
[00:25:06] so the Watch gives Craster trade, and weapons. This monster is a “friend” to the Watch.
[00:25:13] One of Craster’s daughter-wives, Gilly, begs Jon for help. She’s pregnant, and she wants Jon to
[00:25:19] take her and her baby to safety. Jon wants to help her, but the Watch won’t protect a wildling girl,
[00:25:25] and won’t defy their friend Craster. So Jon feels ashamed. He had thought that the Night’s Watch
[00:25:32] were the good guys, but they won’t help this innocent girl, and they befriend the monstrous
[00:25:36] Craster. Ned taught Jon that it’s wrong to make alliances with evil men. So Jon questions if the
[00:25:43] Night’s Watch is doing the right thing. Jeor says the Watch’s only purpose is to guard the realm,
[00:25:49] not to do justice – that sometimes, you have to tolerate evil for the greater good. So
[00:25:55] Jon wonders if it’s right to compromise your morals. If you protect the realm,
[00:26:00] but tolerate evil, what are you saving? At Craster’s Keep, there’s a bear skull
[00:26:07] on display. And Jeor Mormont’s nickname is the Old Bear. So the bear skull foreshadows Jeor’s
[00:26:13] death at Craster’s Keep later on. Jeor learns that the wildling king
[00:26:18] Mance Rayder has gathered the wildlings in the Frostfang mountains. That’s why those villages
[00:26:24] were abandoned. So the rangers continue north to the Fist of the First Men. The Fist is a hill
[00:26:30] defended by walls built by the ancient First Men. It’s a mysterious, powerful, prehistoric place,
[00:26:38] like a… fantasy Stonehenge. Ghost acts weird at the Fist, and he leads Jon to a hidden
[00:26:44] package – it’s a bunch of dragonglass blades, and an old horn, in a Night’s Watch cloak. Weapons
[00:26:51] made of dragonglass can kill white walkers. And this horn might be the Horn of Winter, a legendary
[00:26:59] artifact with the power to destroy the Wall. Someone must’ve put this here to help Jon and
[00:27:05] the Watch fight the white walkers, and to keep the Horn safe. Maybe it was put here by Uncle Benjen.
[00:27:11] Or by Coldhands, the mysterious undead servant of Bloodraven. In the TV show, Benjen is Coldhands,
[00:27:19] but in the books Benjen and Coldhands might be separate characters. It’s confusing. But either
[00:27:24] way, Bloodraven could be behind this. Bloodraven might’ve influenced Ghost to lead Jon here – that
[00:27:31] would explain Ghost’s weird behaviour. In the TV show, Sam randomly finds this package, but
[00:27:38] in the books it’s Jon, guided by mystical forces. Qhorin Halfhand arrives. Qhorin is a legendary
[00:27:47] ranger – the wildings’ deadliest enemy. He’s called the Halfhand because he lost some fingers
[00:27:53] in battle with wildlings. Qhorin says Mance plans to attack the realm, and to break the
[00:28:00] Wall with magic – using the Horn of Winter. So Qhorin leads a mission to investigate,
[00:28:06] and he chooses Jon to come with him. Because Qhorin notices that Jon has Ghost, and has the
[00:28:12] blood of the Starks, connected to the old gods. So Jon, Qhorin, and his men journey into the
[00:28:18] mountains. It’s a harsh land, but Jon sees beautiful waterfalls, wildflowers,
[00:28:24] and ravines – turns out there is beauty in adventure sometimes. They see wildlings ahead,
[00:28:30] so Jon climbs a dangerous mountain trail and kills a wildling called Orell. Orell is the
[00:28:37] first person Jon has ever killed, not including that zombie. And Orell is a skinchanger who’s
[00:28:44] magically connected to his eagle, so when Orell dies, Orell’s spirit lives on inside
[00:28:50] his animal. For the rest of the book, Orell’s eagle follows Jon, spying on him, wanting revenge.
[00:28:58] Jon also faces a wildling named Ygritte. Jon had been taught that wildlings are all nasty evil
[00:29:05] murderers. But Ygritte is a girl with red hair – she reminds him of Arya. Jon doesn’t want to kill
[00:29:13] this girl. So Jon captures her, and they talk, and she shows him a different perspective on the
[00:29:19] world. Like, the Watch says wildlings are invaders and thieves, but from Ygritte’s perspective,
[00:29:25] the southerners stole the wildlings’ land. Jon thinks he’s from “the north”, but from
[00:29:31] Ygritte’s point of view, Jon is from the south, and she’s from the north. Everything’s relative.
[00:29:37] Good and evil can depend on your perspective. Ygritte tells a story about a wildling called
[00:29:44] Bael. Bael had a baby with a Stark girl, and that baby became a Stark king. So
[00:29:50] the Starks and the wildlings are related. They’re family. So why are they enemies?
[00:29:57] The story of Bael and the Stark girl also mirrors the story of Rhaegar and Lyanna Stark – Bael took
[00:30:04] a blue winter rose from Winterfell, and blue winter roses were Lyanna’s favourite flower.
[00:30:10] Bael and the Stark hid in the Winterfell crypts – which is a hint that Jon will find out about his
[00:30:17] parents in the crypts. Jon has recurring dreams of the crypts, where he’s searching for his father,
[00:30:23] and he knows he has to go down there. Ygritte is a wilding warrior, an enemy of
[00:30:31] the Watch. So Jon prepares to kill her. But then he thinks of Ned. Ned said that when you execute
[00:30:38] someone, you should look in their eyes, and hear their words, to see if they really deserve to die.
[00:30:45] When Jon looks in Ygritte’s eyes, he sees no evil. So Jon follows Ned’s example of justice and mercy.
[00:30:53] And he decides to let Ygritte go free. In the TV show, it’s different – Ygritte
[00:30:59] escapes from Jon, and he chases her, running and jumping through the mountains. But in the book,
[00:31:20] Jon chooses to spare Ygritte, he makes a moral decision. He's learning that the world is more
[00:31:26] complex than Watch good, and wildlings bad. People are not just black-and-white.
[00:31:34] That night, Jon has a crazy dream. He magically connects with Ghost, and he sees a weirwood tree
[00:31:41] with Bran’s face. Bran connects with Jon and Ghost from afar through the magic of the old gods, and
[00:31:48] he shows Jon a huge wildling army nearby. Then, Ghost is attacked by Orell’s eagle. When Ghost
[00:31:56] returns injured, it proves that Jon’s dream was real. Qhorin says Jon is a warg, connected to his
[00:32:04] wolf. He says magic is returning to the world – “old powers are waking”, and “the trees have eyes
[00:32:11] again”. In the TV show, Qhorin is not interested in magic or Ghost. The show removes most of the
[00:32:18] magic from Jon’s story. But in the books, Jon is influenced by dreams, magic and prophecies,
[00:32:24] leading him towards a mysterious destiny. The Watch men retreat, but wildlings chase
[00:32:31] them through the mountains. The men split up until it’s just Jon and Qhorin left.
[00:32:37] Since Qhorin is a famous ranger, he knows that the wildlings will kill him. But the wildlings
[00:32:43] might spare Jon. Qhorin tells Jon to join the wildlings – to infiltrate the enemy and
[00:32:49] find out their plans. Jon doesn’t want to be a spy. He wanted to become an honourable hero,
[00:32:57] not a sneaky traitor. But sometimes a hero has to sacrifice their honour for the greater good.
[00:33:05] When Jon and Qhorin are caught by the wildlings, Qhorin pretends to be angry at Jon, and attacks
[00:33:10] him, and lets Jon kill him. With the Halfhand dead, the wildlings let Jon live. For now.
[00:33:19] So in Book 2, Jon finally gets an adventure beyond the Wall. But it’s not like expected. Turns out,
[00:33:27] the Night’s Watch aren’t all good, cause they work with Craster and don’t help Gilly. And
[00:33:32] the wildlings aren’t all evil – some of them are cute redheads. Jon has to kill one of his
[00:33:38] sworn brothers, and join the enemy, making him question his loyalties, his morality,
[00:33:44] and his identity. He feels he’s lost his Stark family, and now he’s lost his Watch brothers,
[00:33:51] too. So who is he now? It also seems that he’s a warg, magically connected to his wolf,
[00:33:59] and to the old gods, so what is he now? In Book 3, Jon is captive crow,
[00:34:07] surrounded by thousands of wildlings. He meets the wildling king Mance Rayder,
[00:34:12] and asks to join their side. In the TV show, this scene is tense – the wildlings are cold,
[00:34:18] and threatening. In the books, it is tense, but it’s also warm and colourful. Mance plays music
[00:34:26] and sings. Tormund tells jokes. We meet Mance’s pregnant wife, Dalla. And Dalla’s sister Val,
[00:34:32] and her lover, all cooking and drinking together. The wildlings aren’t just threatening, they’re a
[00:34:39] family – and family is what Jon has always wanted. The wildlings aren’t all nice – Rattleshirt
[00:34:46] threatens to sew a weasel inside Jon’s belly. The wildling chief Harma Dogshead kills a dog
[00:34:53] each fortnight. And there’s Styr, the leader of a wildling group called the Thenns. In the TV show,
[00:35:01] Styr is a scary cannibal who threatens to eat Olly’s mum. But in the books,
[00:35:07] Styr is a more reasonable political leader. The Thenns are the most technologically advanced and
[00:35:12] socially organised wildling culture. They forge bronze weapons, and have lords and laws. Which is
[00:35:18] important later, when Jon tries to integrate the Thenns into the realm. Wildlings aren’t all the
[00:35:24] same – their cultures are unique and colourful. In the TV show, Mance is a just a tough proud
[00:35:31] wildling leader. But in the books, Mance has layers. He’s more smart, charismatic,
[00:35:38] and passionate, with a real philosophy to his motivations. Mance was raised by the Night’s
[00:35:44] Watch, but he left to join the wildlings. Because Mance wants freedom, individuality,
[00:35:49] pleasure. He joined the wildlings “for a place where a kiss was not a crime”,
[00:35:54] where “a man could wear any cloak he chose”. The wildlings call themselves the free folk,
[00:36:00] cause they don’t kneel to lords or kings. They do sometimes follow kings like Mance,
[00:36:06] but only by choice – they’re always free to do what they want. Free folk are not divided
[00:36:11] into highborn and lowborn, or trueborn and bastards. And women have more equality,
[00:36:16] with spearwives like Ygritte fighting alongside men. The wildling life is dangerous, but Ygritte
[00:36:22] says freedom and pleasure are worth the risk. So compared to the Night’s Watch, those cold
[00:36:29] lonely men with no freedom and no families, the wildling life is way more fun. Free folk society
[00:36:36] is more fair than the exploitative class system of the south. Jon tells Mance that he wants to
[00:36:41] join the wildlings because they treat bastards equally, unlike southerners who discriminate
[00:36:46] against bastards. Mance is suspicious of Jon, but Jon’s knowledge of the Watch is useful – so Mance
[00:36:48] lets him join them. Secretly, Jon’s still loyal to the Watch. But he is tempted by
[00:36:54] the wildlings’ freedom, equality, and warmth. Suddenly, Jon is attacked by Orell’s eagle.
[00:37:01] Orell’s spirit wants revenge for Jon killing him, so the eagle tears up Jon’s face. So Jon is left
[00:37:09] scarred and haunted by the ghost of the first man he killed – his violence has consequences.
[00:37:16] The wildlings go to the Fist, and they learn that the Night’s Watch
[00:37:19] were attacked here by white walkers. In this battle, hundreds of Watch men were killed.
[00:37:25] And then Commander Jeor is killed in a mutiny. So with the Watch scattered, now’s a good time
[00:37:31] for the wildlings to attack. Mance sends Styr and Ygritte and Jon and a hundred wildlings to
[00:37:37] climb the Wall and attack Castle Black. Mance says if Jon is disloyal, cut out his heart.
[00:37:45] Ygritte helps Jon be accepted by the wildlings. She’s grateful that Jon spared her life. She
[00:37:50] also has a big crush on Jon, and wants to have sex with him. Jon is reluctant – cause
[00:37:56] Watch men aren’t meant to have sex. And Jon has always been determined to never father a
[00:38:02] bastard. As a bastard, Jon suffered prejudice all his life, so he doesn’t wanna get Ygritte
[00:38:07] pregnant and bring another bastard into the world. But Tormund reminds Jon that wildlings
[00:38:12] don’t discriminate. They’re free to have sex and have kids with whoever they want, without shame.
[00:38:18] And Ygritte explains more of the wildling philosophy. She says “The gods made the
[00:38:23] earth for all men t’ share”, and that it’s wrong for southern kings to rule over land
[00:38:29] and people. She shows Jon that giants aren’t monsters – they’re a unique culture, and it’s
[00:38:36] tragic that they’re going extinct. Just as it’s tragic that the wildlings are under threat,
[00:38:41] they might go extinct. Ygritte says “You know nothing, Jon Snow” – teaching him whole new
[00:38:47] political and moral perspectives on the world. So Jon feels conflicted, and confused,
[00:38:54] and horny. Jon is a sixteen year old boy, and this redhead is throwing herself at him. So Jon
[00:39:00] has sex with Ygritte – he loses his virginity, and breaks his oath. Breaks his oath in spirit, if not
[00:39:07] technically. They have a particularly memorable tryst in a cave, and Ygritte says she never wants
[00:39:14] to leave. With Ygritte, Jon experiences love and sex and freedom. He wants to be with her. But deep
[00:39:22] down, Jon knows he’s not a wildling, he’s of the Starks and the north, and he will have to leave
[00:39:28] Ygritte to protect his home from her people. Like Romeo and Juliet, Jon and Ygritte are star-crossed
[00:39:35] lovers, on opposing sides, both doomed to die. Jon and the wildlings climb the Wall. In the TV
[00:39:43] show, this is dramatic – they all climb up by hand, and Jon falls, and Ygritte falls,
[00:39:49] and Jon saves her. But in the book, it’s only a small team of climbing experts who climb by hand.
[00:39:55] From the top of the Wall, they drop a rope ladder so the others can climb up more easily. And they
[00:40:00] start climbing from the top of a hill, where the Wall is not as tall. George Martin really thought
[00:40:06] about the most logical and realistic way to climb a seven hundred foot magic ice wall.
[00:40:13] South of the Wall, they find an old man, and Styr tells Jon to kill him – to test Jon’s loyalty.
[00:40:20] Jon looks in the man’s eyes, and he thinks of Ned Stark. So Jon refuses to kill this innocent man.
[00:40:28] With Ygritte, Jon refused to kill a wildling. Now he refuses to kill a southerner – Jon rejects the
[00:40:34] black-and-white morality of the Watch versus wildlings, and protects people on both sides
[00:40:41] of the Wall. Before Styr can cut out Jon’s heart, Jon is saved by Bran. Because Bran and his mates
[00:40:48] are hiding nearby, and Bran wargs his direwolf to attack the wildlings. So once again, the magic of
[00:40:55] the old gods guide Jon. Jon escapes the wildlings, though Ygritte shoots him with an arrow.
[00:41:03] The TV show adds more scenes that deepen the drama between Jon and Ygritte. The actors Kit
[00:41:09] Harington and Rose Leslie have great chemistry – so good that they are now married with kids.
[00:41:15] Jon returns to Castle Black. And in the show, this is where Season 3 ends. The
[00:41:21] first three seasons are pretty close to the books – but from Season 4 onwards,
[00:41:26] the show gets increasingly different to the books. Season 4 adds a plotline where Jon goes back to
[00:41:33] Craster’s Keep, to kill the mutineers who killed Jeor. In the books, it’s Coldhands who kills these
[00:41:40] mutineers – then he feeds their bodies to Bran. But in the show, Jon fights the mutineers,
[00:41:47] who are led by Karl Fookin Tanner – a cartoonishly evil villain. The books are about Jon learning a
[00:41:55] more complex moral perspective, fighting emotional battles in his heart. But this show plotline…
[00:42:03] it’s about good guys killing bad guys. Karl does teach Jon a lesson about fighting dirty,
[00:42:09] and the cost of honour. But most of this plot is filler. The show starts to make
[00:42:15] changes that miss the meaning of the books. In the book, Jon gets back to Castle Black,
[00:42:21] and he’s a mess. His leg is wounded, his heart is broken from leaving Ygritte,
[00:42:27] he finds out that Winterfell was burned and Bran and Rickon are believed dead.
[00:42:32] But Jon puts aside his pain, and focusses on protecting others. The wildlings are coming,
[00:42:38] and Castle Black is not ready. Officer Bowen Marsh took most of their men off chasing wildling feint
[00:42:45] attacks. So now there’s only forty men left to defend Castle Black. Styr has a hundred wildlings,
[00:42:52] south of the Wall. So it looks like they’re doomed. But Jon and Donal make a plan.
[00:43:00] Styr’s wildlings attack. And Jon shoots at them with arrows. Jon
[00:43:05] knows these wildlings. He travelled with them, climbed the Wall with them. And now
[00:43:10] he has to kill them. When Jon sees Ygritte, he can’t bring himself to kill his lover.-
[00:43:17] The Watch men retreat up the Wall, and the wildlings chase them up the
[00:43:21] stairs. So then Jon and Donal spring their trap – they burn and collapse the stairs,
[00:43:27] killing Styr and his wildlings. So in the TV show, Jon has an epic sword fight with Styr.
[00:43:34] But in the book, Jon uses a smart plan to win. After the battle, Jon finds Ygritte, wounded. He
[00:43:42] holds her in his arms, tells her she’ll be okay. She says he knows nothing, and she dies. Ygritte
[00:43:49] showed Jon freedom and love, and that’s what makes it meaningful that Jon gives up his love
[00:43:56] to defend the realm. Jon feels terrible guilt for betraying Ygritte, and that pain never leaves him.
[00:44:04] Styr is dead. But north of the Wall is Mance’s army – tens of thousands of wildlings,
[00:44:11] with cavalry, and chariots, and a hundred giants riding a hundred mammoths. Some mammoths have
[00:44:18] towers full of bowmen on their backs, like the oliphaunts in Lord of the Rings. This is
[00:44:23] the full strength of the free folk, “The fury of the wild”, come to smash their way south.
[00:44:30] Jon looks at the wildlings and thinks “There is no place for you here. Go away”. This same line
[00:44:38] is also in a dream Jon has about Winterfell – the Stark statues tell Jon “There is no place
[00:44:45] for you here. Go away”. It’s also similar to when Catelyn tells Jon to “go away”,
[00:44:50] “We don’t want you here”. So Jon’s rejection from the Stark family is like how the wildlings
[00:44:56] are rejected from the realm. The wildlings and Jon are both outcasts, and he feels sympathy
[00:45:02] for them. But he can’t let this army invade his homeland. He’s conflicted. But he keeps his oath.
[00:45:11] The Watch men shoot at the wildlings from atop the Wall, while the wildlings try to break the
[00:45:16] gate into the Wall’s tunnel. Which doesn’t make much sense – cause the wildlings can’t hurt the
[00:45:21] Watch men up on the Wall, and the thousands of wildlings can’t all attack the gate at once,
[00:45:26] so most of them just stand around getting shot. Wildlings are not great at tactics.
[00:45:33] But a giant named Mag the Mighty breaks into the tunnel. And he’s stopped by
[00:45:38] Donal Noye. The great giant and the humble smith die together. With Donal dead, Jon takes command.
[00:45:46] This battle continues for days. The Watch men fix the gate. The wildlings build a ram. So
[00:45:53] Jon drops barrels of gravel to smash the ram. And the wildlings back off.
[00:45:58] So again, this is different to the TV show. In the show, Jon fights the wildlings with his sword
[00:46:04] like a badass. But in the books, Jon stays out of close combat. Jon is only sixteen in the books,
[00:46:10] and he’s not a great warrior. So instead, Jon uses smart ideas, like the barrels and the burning
[00:46:16] stairs. He plans to improve the Wall’s defences with hoardings and turnable trebuchets. Book Jon
[00:46:23] is not just a fighter. He’s a smart leader. So Jon holds the Wall. With just forty men,
[00:46:30] against thousands of wildlings. Then Night’s Watch reinforcements arrive – led by Alliser Thorne and
[00:46:38] Janos Slynt. Janos was commander of the City Watch in King’s Landing – after Janos betrayed
[00:46:44] Ned Stark, he was sent to the Wall. Janos makes friends with Alliser, who still hates Jon – so
[00:46:51] together they accuse Jon of joining the wildlings, and murdering Qhorin. They use Jon’s bastardy and
[00:46:57] his old gods against him, using prejudice to make Jon look bad. When they insult Ned, Jon gets angry
[00:47:04] and attacks Alliser. So Janos and Alliser send Jon on a suicide mission to kill Mance Rayder.
[00:47:11] Jon knows this won’t work – he’s already betrayed Mance, the wildlings will kill him, but he has
[00:47:18] no choice. So Jon bravely faces death. Jon had wanted to prove himself worthy and honourable,
[00:47:26] Ned Stark’s true son. But even after all his sacrifices, he’s still hated and rejected,
[00:47:33] seen as a traitor by both wildlings and the Watch. Being heroic does not get Jon the love he craves.
[00:47:42] Jon goes to the wildlings. And Tormund is friendly. They chat about Tormund’s family, and
[00:47:49] toast to the memory of Donal, Mag, and Ygritte. There are good people on both sides of this war
[00:47:55] – so the conflict feels tragic and pointless. Then Jon faces Mance. Mance wants to end the
[00:48:06] fighting. He says his “people have bled enough”. The white walkers have been attacking the
[00:48:12] wildlings for years, driving them from their land. So the wildlings need to get south of
[00:48:17] the Wall to escape the dead. The wildlings aren’t just invaders, they’re refugees. Though Jon knows
[00:48:25] that some of the wildlings are brutal raiders, so it’s not so easy to just let the wildlings in.
[00:48:31] Mance says he has the Horn of Winter, and threatens to use it to destroy the Wall.
[00:48:36] Though this horn is probably a fake. Jon considers sacrificing himself to break the
[00:48:41] Horn. But at the last moment, the wildlings are attacked – by Stannis Baratheon’s army.
[00:48:48] The Night’s Watch sent letters to every king in the realm, begging for help against the wildlings.
[00:48:54] And the only one who shows up to protect the realm is Stannis. Stannis’ knights quickly defeat the
[00:49:01] disorganised wildlings. And Jon protects Mance’s wife Dalla as she dies giving birth to a baby.
[00:49:09] So Stannis saves the Night’s Watch. He wants to defeat the white walkers and win the Iron
[00:49:14] Throne. So he needs to take the north, which is currently ruled by the Boltons. Stannis needs a
[00:49:21] northern leader loyal to him. So Stannis offers to legitimise Jon, to make him legally trueborn,
[00:49:27] not a bastard. Jon Snow would become Jon Stark, the Lord of Winterfell. This is what Jon has
[00:49:35] always wanted – to be a true Stark, Ned’s heir. To defy the rejection of Catelyn, and his envy of
[00:49:43] Robb, and to claim Winterfell as his home. Stannis also wants to marry Jon to Val, the sister-in-law
[00:49:50] of King Mance, so that Jon and Val might form an alliance between the north and the wildlings. Jon
[00:49:57] is attracted to Val. She’s beautiful, capable, and witty – she flirts with Jon, and Jon fantasises
[00:50:03] about having children with her at Winterfell. Jon wants this more than anything. But to rule
[00:50:11] Winterfell, he’d have to leave the Night’s Watch, desert his sworn brothers. And Stannis’ priestess
[00:50:17] Melisandre wants Jon to burn the Winterfell weirwood tree, and to worship her fire god
[00:50:22] R’hllor. Jon can’t betray his father’s gods, the gods of Ghost and of his dreams. So Jon is tempted
[00:50:31] by Stannis’ offer. But the Watch needs Jon. With Commander Jeor dead, the Watch holds an
[00:50:40] election to choose a new leader. Janos Slynt almost wins the vote. But Sam does some sneaky
[00:50:47] political manipulation to help Jon win. Jon doesn’t want to be Commander. And some Watch
[00:50:54] men see Jon as a traitor, a bastard and a warg. But others think Jon’s a good choice,
[00:51:00] because he was Commander Jeor’s steward, and Ned Stark’s son and Benjen’s nephew, he stopped the
[00:51:06] wildlings. And Jon also gets support from a raven. Cause Jeor Mormont had a talking pet raven. And
[00:51:15] at the final vote, this raven reappears and says “Snow, snow”, and lands on Jon’s shoulder
[00:51:22] – like a sign that Jon should be the next Commander. So Jon wins the vote and becomes
[00:51:28] the 998th Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch. It’s pretty weird that a talking raven helps
[00:51:36] Jon win an election. This raven often seems intelligent throughout the books, as though
[00:51:42] it understands human language. Later, the raven seems to give Jon a dream about fighting the dead
[00:51:49] with a flaming sword and black ice armour, and the raven says “King”, “Snow, Jon Snow”,
[00:51:54] then wakes Jon with a “gnarled hand”. So some fans think that this raven is magically controlled by
[00:52:02] Bloodraven. We know that Bloodraven can magically control animals, and he has used ravens to spy in
[00:52:09] the past. So maybe Bloodraven uses this raven to spy and influence the Watch. It looks like he’s
[00:52:15] guiding Jon to lead the Watch to defeat the white walkers, and perhaps to become a king.
[00:52:22] The TV show removes the talking raven, and removes Sam’s sneaky politicking – it takes
[00:52:28] away the magic, and the morally murky politics, and just has Jon win because he’s a cool guy.
[00:52:34] But Jon becomes commander of the Watch – the Wall is his, the night is dark,
[00:52:41] and now he’s got Stannis to deal with. In Book 3, Jon tastes freedom and love
[00:52:47] with Ygritte – but he gives that up for his duty to the realm. Stannis offers to make Jon the Stark
[00:52:54] of Winterfell, his deepest desire. But again Jon sacrifices his desires for the greater good. Jon
[00:53:02] wants to do the right thing, but it’s hard to know which choice is right. The wildlings show
[00:53:08] him a whole different perspective on politics and morality – good and evil are more complex than he
[00:53:13] thought. And every choice Jon makes has a painful cost. He’s lost the Starks, he’s lost Ygritte,
[00:53:21] he’s lost friends in battle, leaving Jon wounded and traumatised. He becomes more withdrawn,
[00:53:28] sad, and isolated, as he struggles to do the right thing in an impossibly complex world.
[00:53:36] In the book, Commander Jon Snow walks a dangerous political tightrope. Jon has to help Stannis,
[00:53:43] or else Stannis will destroy him. But if he helps Stannis too much, the Lannisters will destroy
[00:53:49] them. Cersei actually plots to assassinate Jon in the books, but she fails. Jon also needs to make
[00:53:56] peace between the Night’s Watch and the wildlings before the white walkers come and kill them all.
[00:54:01] So Can Jon unite everyone to survive this winter? In Book 5 and Season 5, Jon’s plotline becomes
[00:54:09] very different in the books compared to the TV show.
[00:54:14] Aemon says “Kill the boy and let the man be born”. Jon must let go of his innocence and weakness,
[00:54:21] must make hard choices, and “do the things that must be done”.
[00:54:26] So Jon makes tough decisions. He sends his best friend Sam far away to the south to become a
[00:54:32] maester. Sam doesn’t want to go, so Jon forces Sam to leave. Sam feels that Jon has changed,
[00:54:40] he’s not Jon any more, he’s become “Lord Snow”, a harsh cold leader. Many characters call him
[00:54:47] “Lord Snow” now. It started as Alliser’s mocking nickname, but now the name is a
[00:54:52] source of strength – just like Tyrion suggested. Jon also sends Aemon south. Because Melisandre
[00:54:59] wants people with kings’ blood so she can burn them in magic rituals – Aemon has king’s blood,
[00:55:06] because he’s a Targaryen – so Jon sends Aemon south to save him from Melisandre. Even though
[00:55:12] Jon knows that Aemon’s so old that he might die on this journey. And he does.
[00:55:18] And Jon makes another harsh decision – he sends Gilly south, but he secretly forces Gilly to
[00:55:24] abandon her baby, and to instead take Mance and Dalla’s baby south. Because King Mance’s
[00:55:30] baby also has king’s blood – Melisandre might burn him. So to save him, Jon secretly swaps
[00:55:37] the babies. Gilly begs Jon to let her keep her child, and Jon does feel terrible, but Lord Snow
[00:55:44] stays strong, and cold, does what must be done. Jon promises to protect Gilly’s baby – like how
[00:55:52] Ned promised to protect Lyanna’s baby. Jon says goodbye to Sam and Aemon and Gilly,
[00:55:59] and remembers saying goodbye to Robb. Jon keeps losing the people closest to him.
[00:56:05] Leadership makes Jon isolated. As Lord Commander, he has to be an authority, above his men,
[00:56:12] so he feels he can’t hang out with his friends any more. Jon sends Grenn and Pyp and Edd away
[00:56:18] to other castles, leaving Jon alone, friendless, and vulnerable. He no longer has the advice or
[00:56:25] protection of loyal friends when he needs them. Jon resigns himself to a cold, lonely life,
[00:56:32] and focusses on his duty. Jon often works all night, barely sleeping. Maybe on some level, Jon
[00:56:40] is punishing himself – out of guilt for Ygritte. Jon also spends a lot of time training at combat,
[00:56:47] cause he wants to be a better swordsman. In the books so far, Jon isn’t a great
[00:56:52] warrior. But this training could make Jon a much better fighter in the final battles.
[00:56:58] Janos disobeys Jon’s orders. So Jon executes Janos. Like Ned, Jon looks in the man’s eyes,
[00:57:06] hears his last words, and then cuts off his head. Previously, Jon chose not to kill Ygritte
[00:57:12] and chose not to kill that old man – but this time he does kill – Lord Commander Snow won’t
[00:57:19] tolerate defiance. But killing Janos is also personal – cause Janos tried to get Jon killed,
[00:57:26] and Janos betrayed Ned, so killing Janos is revenge. There’s still tension between Jon’s duty
[00:57:33] to the Night’s Watch and his love for the Starks. Stannis and Melisandre execute Mance Rayder by
[00:57:40] burning him alive. –Though in the books, this is a magic illusion, and Mance is secretly still alive,
[00:57:47] working for Melisandre. Stannis lets a thousand wildlings through the Wall. Melisandre makes them
[00:57:54] burn a piece of weirwood to symbolise accepting R’hllor as their god. And Stannis shows off his
[00:58:00] glowing sword Lightbringer. Melisandre says that Stannis is the prophesied hero Azor Ahai.
[00:58:07] But Jon sees that Stannis’ sword is not the real Lightbringer. So if Stannis is not the messiah,
[00:58:14] who is? Jon did have that dream of fighting the dead with a burning sword. And when Melisandre
[00:58:20] looks in her flames for a glimpse of Azor Ahai, she sees Jon “Snow”.
[00:58:26] Many in the Night’s Watch hate wildlings, think they’re all evil barbarians. But Jon
[00:58:32] learned that wildlings are just people, some good and some bad, like anyone else. The Watch
[00:58:38] protects the realms of men – and “what are these wildlings, if not men?”. Jon says all the living
[00:58:45] must unite against the white walkers. So Jon settles the thousand wildlings at Mole’s Town,
[00:58:51] and he personally brings them food. In the same book, Daenerys brings food to refugees, while
[00:58:56] she tries to make peace and unity. Jon and Dany both risk their own lives to end war and protect
[00:59:04] vulnerable people. Jon convinces some wildlings to join the Night’s Watch. He even brings a
[00:59:10] giant named Wun Wun to the Wall. So with bravery and compassion, Jon turns enemies into allies.
[00:59:18] Jon gives Stannis advice to help him take the north. He tells Stannis to rally the mountain
[00:59:23] clans, and to take Deepwood Motte, before he attacks the Boltons at Winterfell. Jon isn’t
[00:59:31] supposed to help Stannis – the Night’s Watch is meant to be neutral in southern wars. But the
[00:59:36] Boltons and Lannisters destroyed Jon’s family – he wants Stannis to defeat them. So again,
[00:59:42] there’s tension between Jon’s Night’s Watch duty and his love for the Starks. Stannis offers again
[00:59:48] to make Jon a Stark, he says the north would follow Ned’s son – and Jon clearly knows a lot
[00:59:55] about northern politics, he’d be a good Lord of Winterfell. But again Jon reluctantly refuses.
[01:00:02] So Stannis and his army march off to war, but he leaves Melisandre and his daughter Shireen and his
[01:00:08] wife Selyse at the Wall. Which is another headache for Jon, cause Selyse is a pain in the arse.
[01:00:15] Melisandre is a priestess of the fire god R’hllor. She sees visions of the future in her flames,
[01:00:21] and she warns Jon that he’s in danger from “daggers in the dark”. She tells Jon to use her
[01:00:28] magic power. But Jon doesn’t trust Melisandre. He doesn’t trust magic. So Melisandre tries to
[01:00:35] prove her power – Melisandre has a vision that three of Jon’s rangers will be killed,
[01:00:40] with their eyes gouged out. And this vision comes true. Maybe Jon should listen to Melisandre.
[01:00:47] Then Melisandre has a vision of “A girl in grey on a dying horse”. And she says this girl is
[01:00:54] Jon’s sister Arya. Cause at Winterfell, Ramsay Bolton marries a girl who he says is Arya Stark.
[01:01:01] The girl actually isn’t Arya, she’s a girl called Jeyne who the Boltons say is Arya, but Jon doesn’t
[01:01:08] know that. So Jon wants to save his sister from the monstrous Ramsay. But he can’t do it himself,
[01:01:14] cause his duty is on the Wall – so Melisandre says she’ll help, by sending Mance Rayder.
[01:01:21] So Melisandre pretended to burn Mance, but that was a trick. He’s actually alive,
[01:01:26] in a magic disguise, apparently under Melisandre’s control. So Melisandre and Jon send Mance on a
[01:01:34] secret mission – Mance and six wilding women go to Winterfell to save Arya. It’s heroic for Jon
[01:01:41] to try to save his sister, but it’s also risky – the Commander of the Night’s Watch is not meant
[01:01:47] to secretly plot with the wildling king, or to take a northman’s wife. Watch men aren’t
[01:01:54] allowed to help their sisters, only their Watch brothers. Jon is putting love ahead of his duty.
[01:02:02] And it turns out Melisandre is wrong about her vision. A girl in grey does arrive at Castle
[01:02:08] Black, but it’s not Arya – it’s Alys Karstark, the heir to House Karstark. Alys’ uncle Cregan
[01:02:15] wants to forcibly marry Alys, to take over House Karstark – and he’s planning to betray Stannis for
[01:02:22] the Boltons. So this is another moral dilemma for Jon. Cause the Night’s Watch is not meant
[01:02:28] to interfere in politics. But Alys begs Jon for help, and she reminds him of Arya. So Jon
[01:02:35] imprisons Cregan, and he warns Stannis of the betrayal, and he sets up a different marriage
[01:02:41] for Alys. Jon marries Alys to Sigorn, the new leader of the Thenn wildlings. The wildlings
[01:02:49] will help Alys claim Karhold. And Jon hopes this marriage will create unity between wildlings and
[01:02:55] the north. At the wedding, Watch men and wildlings dance together – it’s a beautiful moment of joy
[01:03:02] and peace between former enemies. But politically, this is dangerous. Many northmen will be outraged
[01:03:09] that the Watch married a northern girl to a wildling, and helped wildlings take over
[01:03:13] a northern castle. And by imprisoning Cregan, and warning Stannis, Jon has undermined Roose Bolton,
[01:03:20] the Warden of the North, the ally of King Tommen. Jon has to make bold changes to
[01:03:27] prepare for the white walkers. But his radical decisions, his political interference and his
[01:03:33] personal biases put the Night’s Watch in danger. The Night’s Watch has lots of problems. They’ve
[01:03:41] been in decline for centuries. They don’t have enough men. They lost their best leaders like
[01:03:47] Benjen, Qhorin and Aemon. And after hosting Stannis and the wildlings, they don’t have
[01:03:51] enough food for winter. So Jon finds solutions. He meets with Tycho Nestoris, from the Iron Bank – in
[01:03:59] the book, Tycho has a Big Purple Hat. And Jon borrows money from the Bank to buy food. He also
[01:04:06] plans to build greenhouses to grow vegetables in winter. He plans to build beacons along the Wall
[01:04:11] to communicate. Most of the Wall’s castles are abandoned, so Jon starts manning them with Watch
[01:04:18] men and wildlings. Jon trains his men on archery instead of on swords, cause archery’s more useful
[01:04:25] for defending the Wall. Jon talks to Wun Wun to learn about the giants. And he wants to learn
[01:04:31] about the white walkers and their zombies, so Jon locks up some corpses to see if they rise from the
[01:04:36] dead, to try to talk to them. Jon has lots of smart and creative ideas in the book. Compare
[01:04:44] that to the TV show, where Jon is a brave himbo who just fights bad guys and looks sad. And TV
[01:04:51] Jon is stubbornly honest, he “cannot lie”. But book Jon does lie, and has secrets. Like when
[01:04:58] he swaps the babies. Like when he sends Mance to Winterfell. He also sends Val to go find Tormund,
[01:05:05] even though Jon promised Stannis that he wouldn’t. Jon doesn’t like breaking his word, he wants to be
[01:05:11] honourable, but he feels that saving the realm is more important than his honour. Sometimes a
[01:05:16] lie is the right thing to do. The TV show gives Jon morally uncomplicated conflicts,
[01:05:24] battles against evil. But book Jon grapples with difficult ambiguous moral questions.
[01:05:31] Jon also makes change and justice. Cause Benjen said that everyone in the Watch has
[01:05:37] equal opportunities, you get what you earn – but that’s not true. Waymar Royce gets special
[01:05:44] privileges because his dad is a lord. Most of the powerful positions in the Watch go to trueborn men
[01:05:50] from noble families – the Watch isn’t fair. So Jon changes this by giving important positions
[01:05:57] to lowborn people. Jon makes a wildling the new master-at-arms. He gives command of a castle to
[01:06:03] a lowborn guy. And Jon mentors a boy named Satin. Satin was a sex worker, and some men hate him for
[01:06:11] being a boy “whore”. But Jon sees that Satin is smart and brave. So Jon makes Satin his personal
[01:06:17] steward, potentially training Satin for command. Because as a bastard, Jon experienced prejudice
[01:06:24] and injustice. He saw how people like Arya and Sam are discriminated against for being different. So
[01:06:30] as Commander, Jon makes the Watch more fair and more effective – judging people on their ability
[01:06:37] instead of their social class. These changes anger the more traditional men in the Watch. Bowen Marsh
[01:06:43] complains – making change also makes enemies. Beyond the Wall, Tormund leads thousands of
[01:06:51] wildlings desperate to escape the white walkers. So Jon plans to let them through the Wall. He’ll
[01:06:58] house them in castles along the Wall, to help fight the walkers. He takes all the wildlings’
[01:07:03] wealth, including a fancy ivory dildo. And to keep the wildlings loyal, he’ll take a hundred
[01:07:09] boys as hostages. So the wildlings are angry at Jon’s price. And the Watch officers are also
[01:07:16] outraged. These men dedicated their lives to fighting wildlings. Bowen was recently wounded
[01:07:22] by wildlings in battle. So Bowen says it’s treason to let the enemy through the Wall. Jon
[01:07:29] insists they must unite everyone against the white walkers. So he’ll let all the wildlings through,
[01:07:35] even the brutal raiders who gouged the eyes out of those rangers. Jon is determined to save everyone,
[01:07:42] but he fails to compromise, and fails to convince important people of his plan. He
[01:07:48] doesn’t communicate well – he doesn’t even tell First Steward Bowen about his loan from the Iron
[01:07:53] Bank. So Jon makes political mistakes. There’re also thousands of wildlings
[01:07:59] at a village called Hardhome. In the TV show, Jon leads a mission to save them,
[01:08:04] and he kills a white walker. But that doesn’t happen in the books. In the book, Jon sends
[01:08:09] some men to save the wildlings, and we hear it goes badly – there’s “Dead things in the water”.
[01:08:18] Ultimately, Jon lets the wildlings through the Wall. And in the TV show, that’s why Alliser and
[01:08:24] the Watch men kill Jon. Jon does the right thing and he dies for it – it’s morally uncomplicated
[01:08:32] in the show. But in the book, there’s more to it. In the book, Jon gets a letter from Ramsay Bolton.
[01:08:39] Ramsay says that Stannis is dead, defeated in battle. Ramsay says he has Mance prisoner and
[01:08:46] accuses Jon stealing his bride. Cause with the help of Mance’s wildlings, the fake Arya escapes
[01:08:53] Winterfell. So Ramsay demands that Jon give him Arya and Val and Selyse and Melisandre,
[01:09:00] or else he’ll “cut out” Jon’s “bastard’s heart and eat it”. There’re lots of theories about
[01:09:07] this letter, like that Stannis isn’t really dead, and that maybe someone other than Ramsay wrote
[01:09:14] the letter. But this letter is a huge threat to the Night’s Watch, and it’s kind of Jon’s fault.
[01:09:19] Cause as Commander of the Watch, Jon was meant to be politically neutral. But Jon helped Stannis,
[01:09:25] and helped Alys, and sent Mance to take Ramsay’s wife. Because of Jon’s bias for Stannis and the
[01:09:32] Starks, he brings the wrath of the Boltons upon the Watch. All through Book 5, Jon tried to
[01:09:39] balance love and duty, but this letter forces him to choose. Will he submit to Ramsay to save the
[01:09:47] Watch, or will he fight for Arya and Winterfell? Jon thinks about Robb and Bran and Rickon and
[01:09:55] Sansa and Arya. And he decides to fight. Jon publicly reads Ramsay’s letter, revealing his
[01:10:03] secret Mance plot, and Jon declares that he’ll “ride south” to fight Ramsay at Winterfell. He
[01:10:10] also says Tormund will lead the Watch on another wildly dangerous mission to Hardhome. So the
[01:10:17] wildlings rally behind Jon. But the Night’s Watch are furious – Jon is publicly breaking his oath,
[01:10:24] deserting the Wall, involving the Night’s Watch in a war. And that’s why Jon is killed in the books.
[01:10:32] First, there’s a distraction – the giant Wun Wun kills a knight called Ser Patrek. And this
[01:10:38] is a hidden reference to football – the giant represents one of George Martin’s favourite
[01:10:43] teams the New York Giants. And Ser Patrek represents George’s friend Patrick St Denis,
[01:10:49] who supports the Dallas Cowboys – the Cowboys logo is a blue star, so Patrek’s heraldry is
[01:10:56] a blue star. And this football easter egg happens right before Jon is killed.
[01:11:02] Jon tries to calm everyone down, but in the chaos, Bowen Marsh and three others stab Jon,
[01:11:10] and Jon falls, bleeding, in the snow. The killing of Jon Snow is similar to the
[01:11:17] killing of ancient Roman leader Julius Caesar – Jon and Caesar are both seen as a political
[01:11:23] threat, so they’re stabbed to death by their own men. Even small details of the attacks are the
[01:11:30] same. And George is a fan of Roman history, and of Shakespeare’s Caesar play, so he was clearly
[01:11:36] taking inspiration here. Caesar was killed on the Ides of March. And Jon is stabbed by Bowen Marsh.
[01:11:43] So some fans call Jon’s killing the Ides of Marsh. In the TV show, Jon’s assassination is led by the
[01:11:51] cruel and vindictive Alliser Thorne. But in the books, it’s led by Bowen. And Bowen doesn’t hate
[01:11:58] Jon. Bowen is not evil. Even Jon thinks that Bowen is a “good man”. When Bowen stabs Jon,
[01:12:05] Bowen cries. He feels he’s forced to kill Jon, for the Watch. Cause Jon did break his oath, and
[01:12:13] endanger the Watch, out of love for the Starks. So in Book 5, Jon makes tough moral choices,
[01:12:22] plotting and politicking to save lives, make peace, protect the realm. He tries to
[01:12:28] balance duty with love – helping Arya and Alys and Stannis. But when Jon’s forced to choose between
[01:12:35] the Watch and the Starks, he chooses love. Love is the death of duty. And it’s the death of Jon Snow.
[01:12:45] So what happens next? George Martin is still
[01:12:49] writing the next books to finish the series. But there’s lots of foreshadowing and theories about
[01:12:54] what will happen in The Winds of Winter. In the TV show, Jon gets resurrected. When
[01:13:00] he comes back to life, he’s tired and sad, borderline suicidal for a while,
[01:13:06] but his personality is mostly the same. In the books, death will change Jon. George Martin says
[01:13:14] death is a “transformative experience”, his “characters who come back from death” have
[01:13:19] “lost something”. When Beric Dondarrion dies and is resurrected, he loses his memories and his
[01:13:26] identity. When Catelyn dies and is resurrected, she becomes a scary zombie called Lady Stoneheart,
[01:13:33] who’s consumed with hate and revenge. George says if someone suffers a “violent, traumatic death,
[01:13:40] they’re not going to come back as nice as ever”. So how will death change Jon?
[01:13:47] In the TV show, Jon’s resurrection is simple – Melisandre gives him a prayer
[01:13:52] and a --haircut -- and he comes back to life. But in the books, Jon’s resurrection will be
[01:13:58] complicated. Cause there are hints that Jon’s soul will go inside his direwolf, Ghost. The
[01:14:04] books explain that when a skinchanger dies, their spirit can live on in their animal – it’s called
[01:14:10] a “second life”. We saw Orell live on in his eagle after he died. Then we see the skinchanger Varamyr
[01:14:17] live on in his wolf. Varamyr thinks that Jon is a powerful warg, and that Ghost “would be
[01:14:24] a second life worthy of a king”. Melisandre has a vision of Jon being “a man”, then “a wolf”,
[01:14:31] then “a man again” – hinting that Jon will live inside Ghost for a while, then he’ll come back in
[01:14:36] his human body. In Book 5, Jon’s connection with Ghost gets “stronger”, he feels that he and Ghost
[01:14:43] are “one”. And when Jon is stabbed, his last word is “Ghost”. So these are strong hints that Jon’s
[01:14:51] ghost will live in Ghost for a while. Why? The books say that skinchanging changes your
[01:15:00] personality, it makes you more like your animal. When someone has a second life in their wolf,
[01:15:06] their human memory slowly fades, til “only the beast remains”. So being in Ghost could make
[01:15:13] Jon less human, and more wolfish. Ned says that Brandon and Lyanna Stark had “The wolf blood”,
[01:15:21] making them wild and reckless. Jon is sometimes aggressive and impulsive in the books – he attacks
[01:15:27] Alliser twice, and has a violent outburst in training. Usually Jon controls these emotions,
[01:15:34] supresses his desires – he thinks “I am a man, not a wolf”. But being murdered and then soul-merged
[01:15:42] with his beast might finally unleash Jon’s wolf blood, making him a more reckless, dangerous
[01:15:49] character, more focussed on his own desires. This would be similar to Daenerys’ storyline.
[01:15:56] Cause in Book 5, like Jon, Daenerys tries to make peace. She suppresses her own desires for
[01:16:01] the sake of politics and the greater good. But at the end of the book, like Jon, she has a downfall,
[01:16:07] and this crisis changes her. As she wanders the Dothraki Sea alone, she has visions from
[01:16:14] Quaithe that remind her of her Targaryen identity. Daenerys rejects peace and embraces her desires
[01:16:21] for “Fire and Blood”, and to go home to Westeros. So Jon might embrace his desires to go home to
[01:16:29] Winterfell. And Jon could also have visions. He’s already had visions from Bloodraven,
[01:16:35] and from Bran, through Ghost. So maybe as a spirit in Ghost, he’ll have more visions. Jon
[01:16:41] could find out that Bran and Rickon are still alive. Bloodraven could tell him his destiny to
[01:16:46] become King in the North and to defeat the white walkers. To fulfil the prophecy of Azor Ahai.
[01:16:53] Visions could reveal secrets, unlock power, give Jon new purpose to pursue his destiny.
[01:17:01] Though, in this world, visions and dreams can be destructive. Sinister forces might
[01:17:07] use visions to influence people. Can Jon trust his visions, or is Bloodraven manipulating him?
[01:17:15] Jon’s spirit could stay in Ghost for a while. Maybe as a wolf, he’ll roam beyond the Wall,
[01:17:22] and find uncle Benjen, or learn the secrets of the white walkers. He could go to Hardhome,
[01:17:28] or help Bran come south. He could have lots of adventures, gallivanting through the woods in
[01:17:33] the brain of wolf, tripping on vision… But Jon won’t be a dog forever.☹ Eventually he’ll be
[01:17:40] resurrected in his human body, and like in the TV show, it’ll probably be Melisandre who does
[01:17:46] it – in the book, Melisandre says you’ll “have grave need of me”, and “I am your only hope”.
[01:17:54] When Jon is resurrected, there might be a cost. Cause when Beric resurrects Stoneheart,
[01:18:00] Beric dies. When Mirri heals Drogo, Daenerys’ baby dies. When Daenerys hatches dragons,
[01:18:07] Mirri dies. Melisandre says “Only death can pay for life”, “A great gift requires a great
[01:18:14] sacrifice”. So what sacrifice will pay for Jon’s life? Maybe Melisandre will sacrifice herself. Or
[01:18:23] maybe Ghost will die – if Jon and Ghost’s spirits are merged together, will there be anything left
[01:18:29] of Ghost to live in Ghost’s body? Melisandre says king’s blood is a particularly powerful sacrifice,
[01:18:36] so maybe the sacrifice will be King Mance or King Stannis or Princess Shireen. Melisandre
[01:18:42] prophesies that king’s blood will wake a dragon from stone. And Shireen has stony greyscale. So
[01:18:50] maybe the dragon is Jon Targaryen, awoken from the sacrifice of stony Shireen. It’s also possible
[01:18:58] that no one will die. Cause when Thoros resurrects Beric, no one dies. Instead, the cost is Beric’s
[01:19:05] humanity – he loses his memories and identity. So maybe it’ll be the same with Jon – he’ll come
[01:19:11] back to life, but at the cost of his soul. In the TV show, after his resurrection,
[01:19:18] Jon looks the same. Just with some sexy new scars. But in the books, Jon’s appearance might change.
[01:19:26] Cause when Catelyn is resurrected, her hair goes white, and her eyes go red. Theon’s hair goes
[01:19:33] white after his symbolic death and rebirth. So maybe Jon will also get white hair and red eyes,
[01:19:40] cause that would have a lot of symbolic meaning. Ghost has white hair and red eyes,
[01:19:46] like Bloodraven and the weirwoods. White hair would make Jon look more like a Targaryen,
[01:19:52] like his father Rhaegar. And red eyes would be like Melisandre’s red eyes, connecting Jon to
[01:19:58] the fire god R’hllor. George says that Beric is “a wight animated by fire instead of by ice”. So will
[01:20:06] Jon be a fire wight? Or will he be an ice wight, like Coldhands? Maybe Bloodraven and Melisandre’s
[01:20:13] magic could both help resurrect Jon, combining the old gods and R’hllor, Stark and Targaryen,
[01:20:20] making Jon a wight of ice and fire. Patchface calls Jon “The crow” and says
[01:20:27] “Under the sea the crows are white as snow” – ‘under the sea’ is a metaphor for death – so
[01:20:34] this could be a hint that undead Jon will have white hair and pale skin. When Jon was a kid,
[01:20:40] he once covered himself in flour to make himself “pale white” like a ghost. In the
[01:20:46] TV show, they call Jon the White Wolf. So there are lots of hints that Jon’s
[01:20:52] death will give him pale skin, white hair, and red eyes, showing that he’s not just
[01:20:58] back to normal – he’s changed, he’s undead. There are perks to being undead. Beric and
[01:21:05] Coldhands and Melisandre don’t need to eat or sleep. It could be useful for Jon to not eat
[01:21:12] or sleep if he has to fight a war, or travel north. But there are also downsides to being
[01:21:20] undead. Beric loses memories, Stoneheart can hardly speak. They look like ugly scary zombies,
[01:21:28] wounded and rotted, their hearts don’t beat. Will Jon become a hideous zombie? If his heart doesn’t
[01:21:35] beat, will his penis still work? That could be disappointing for Daenerys. One theory is that
[01:21:41] after he’s killed, Jon’s corpse will be kept in an ice cell in the Wall. Bran has a vision of Jon
[01:21:48] “sleeping” in a “cold bed” with his skin going pale and cold. Aemon says that the cold of the
[01:21:55] Wall preserves. So an ice cell might prevent Jon’s body from rotting. And unlike Beric and Catelyn,
[01:22:02] Jon is a warg – his spirit won’t die, it’ll live on in Ghost – so maybe that will protect
[01:22:09] his mind and memories. So Jon won’t be too much of a zombie. But he will be changed.
[01:22:17] Aemon said “Kill the boy and let the man be born”. Jon the boy has been killed – so what
[01:22:25] new man will be born? Living in Ghost could unleash his wolf blood, make him more violent
[01:22:32] and reckless. He might have visions from Bloodraven giving him revelations and new
[01:22:38] purpose. He might look different, with white hair and red eyes – a wight of ice and fire.
[01:22:45] The Night’s Watch oath says my watch won’t end “until my death”. So after Jon’s death,
[01:22:52] he’s arguably free from his vows, he can leave the Watch. So what will Jon do in The Winds of Winter?
[01:23:01] After Catelyn and Beric’s resurrections, they focus on their final missions – Catelyn wants
[01:23:07] revenge for the Red Wedding, Beric fights in the riverlands – George says that purpose “is part
[01:23:14] of what’s animating him”. So after Jon’s resurrection, he might be focussed on his
[01:23:19] final mission – fight Ramsay, save Arya, and take Winterfell. He can finally do what he’s
[01:23:26] wanted to do since Book 1 – ride south. In the TV show, Stannis dies, and Jon
[01:23:34] fights the Battle of the Bastards to beat the Boltons and take Winterfell. But in the books,
[01:23:40] it might be Stannis who defeats the Boltons – there are hints that he’ll fake his own death,
[01:23:46] and will win a battle on a frozen lake. So by the time Jon gets to Winterfell,
[01:23:51] Stannis might’ve already won the war. There could be multiple battles,
[01:23:56] Jon might fight Ramsay later. The Stark direwolves might be involved, symbolising
[01:24:01] Jon reuniting with his Stark wolf pack. But if Jon does fight the Boltons, it won’t be like
[01:24:08] the TV show – it won’t just be Jon surviving through dumb luck, and punching Ramsay in the
[01:24:13] face twenty-one times. Like all of book Jon’s conflicts, it’ll be a moral and emotional test.
[01:24:20] In the TV show, Ramsay has Jon’s brother Rickon, and Jon tries to save Rickon, but Rickon dies
[01:24:27] anyway. There’s no meaningful choice or lesson here for TV Jon, Rickon’s death just happens.
[01:24:35] Maybe in the book, Jon will make a moral choice. Like, maybe Ramsay will tell Jon not to attack
[01:24:41] or else he’ll kill Rickon, but since Jon is now more reckless, and because he wants Winterfell,
[01:24:47] Jon attacks anyway, and causes Rickon’s death. This would show that Jon has changed – that
[01:24:54] he’s willing to risk innocent lives to get what he wants. And this could also create conflict between
[01:24:59] Jon and Sansa, who might blame Jon for Rickon’s death. Jon could finally reclaim the home of the
[01:25:06] Starks, but at the cost of alienating his Stark siblings, losing the very family he always wanted.
[01:25:13] This is just speculation. But Jon’s battles in The Winds of Winter will explore what kind of
[01:25:19] person he’s become after his resurrection. What will Jon sacrifice to take Winterfell?
[01:25:27] Once the Boltons are defeated, Stannis might go to the Nightfort and die, possibly killed by white
[01:25:33] walkers after he sacrifices Shireen. So who will rule Winterfell and the north? In the TV show,
[01:25:40] the northern lords make Jon the King in the North. Even though it should be Sansa
[01:25:45] who gets Winterfell, because she’s the eldest known surviving trueborn Stark – in the show,
[01:25:51] the lords ignore the line of succession and make Jon king just because he’s a
[01:25:54] cool guy. But in the books, Jon has an actual legal claim to Winterfell. Cause in Book 3,
[01:26:01] Robb Stark wants Jon to be his heir as King in the North. He considers legitimising Jon, to make him
[01:26:08] a true Stark not a bastard. So Robb writes a will, and the books don’t show us what the will says,
[01:26:15] but it probably names Jon as the next King in the North. Not everyone knows about Robb’s
[01:26:21] will. But Maege Mormont and Galbart Glover know, and they go to Howland Reed in the Neck. Howland
[01:26:27] was at the tower of joy, where Jon was born, so he might know about Jon’s real parents. Maege’s
[01:26:34] daughter is with Stannis’ army, with the mountain clansmen. And two clan leaders visit Jon – and
[01:26:40] Jon suspects that these guys have some secret purpose. Edmure also knows about Robb’s will,
[01:26:47] and two of Edmure’s men go to the Wall. Stoneheart knows about Robb’s will, and has Robb’s crown,
[01:26:54] and she travels to the Neck where Howland and Maege and Galbart are. So there’s a theory that
[01:27:00] there’s a conspiracy to make Jon King in the North. Cause “The north remembers” Ned Stark’s
[01:27:08] legacy of leadership, and Jon is seen as the heir to that legacy. That’s why Alys Karstark comes to
[01:27:14] Jon, because he’s Ned Stark’s son – that means something in the north. So these northmen might
[01:27:22] reveal Robb’s will and declare Jon King in the North. The problem with that is that there are two
[01:27:28] other northern conspiracies happening. Lord Wyman Manderly plans to make Rickon Lord of Winterfell.
[01:27:35] Littlefinger plans to use Sansa and the Vale to claim the north. Plus Bran is still alive,
[01:27:41] and the real Arya will return. And all of these Starks arguably have a better claim to Winterfell
[01:27:47] than Jon does. Robb’s will was written on the assumption that Bran and Rickon were dead. So is
[01:27:52] Robb’s will definitive? Does a legitimised bastard like Jon come before a trueborn child like Sansa?
[01:27:59] The laws of succession in Westeros are vague and subjective. And there are lots of different
[01:28:05] political factions at play here. This could be a messy inheritance struggle, dividing the Stark
[01:28:11] family – and creating deep conflict within Jon. He’ll be torn between his loyalty to his siblings,
[01:28:18] and his desire to be the Stark of Winterfell. In the TV show, Jon doesn’t want to be King
[01:28:25] in the North. It’s another thing that just happens to TV Jon, without his choice. Then
[01:28:31] there’s this weird conflict where Sansa is envious of Jon, and Arya threatens to kill
[01:28:36] Sansa. It’s one of the worst plotlines in the show, partly because Jon has no agency or stakes
[01:28:43] in the conflict cause he doesn’t want Winterfell. In the books, Jon does want Winterfell. As a boy,
[01:28:51] “he used to dream that one day Winterfell might be his”. Jon has a dream where he cuts off Robb’s
[01:28:57] head and screams “I am the Lord of Winterfell”. When Stannis offers him Winterfell, Jon wants
[01:29:04] it more than anything. And his resurrection could make him more focussed on his desires.
[01:29:12] Jon could be a great King in the North. He’s a smart and compassionate leader. He knows about
[01:29:19] northern politics, he’s respected by northmen. He wants to make peace and unify against the
[01:29:24] white walkers. There’s lots of foreshadowing that Jon will be a king – it seems like his destiny.
[01:29:31] But becoming King in the North will have a cost. He might get Rickon killed, or piss off
[01:29:37] Sansa. He might get lots of wildings killed in battle. And the Night’s Watch could fall apart
[01:29:43] without him. To become the Stark of Winterfell, Jon might lose his families – lose the Watch,
[01:29:50] and the wildlings, and the Starks – without them, what’s the point of having Winterfell?
[01:29:58] Jon was never close with Sansa or Rickon. But he loves Arya. Throughout the books,
[01:30:04] Jon and Arya miss each other often, and try to reunite. Jon dies largely because he wants to
[01:30:11] save Arya. So it’ll be super emotional when finally get back together. In the TV show,
[01:30:17] this is a mostly happy reunion. But in the books, it could be darker and sadder.
[01:30:24] Cause Jon and Arya have been through so much. Arya suffered at Harrenhal, joined a death cult,
[01:30:31] murdered people, and she’s still just eleven years old. Jon lost his lover, fought in battles,
[01:30:38] got murdered. They’re both traumatised by death, and have lost their identities. Jon is not just
[01:30:45] Jon the bastard, he’s now an undead Stark king, he’s “Lord Snow”. And Arya has changed her name
[01:30:56] and her face so many times that she’s not Arya, she’s “no one”. Jon and Arya have changed so much,
[01:31:03] they might not recognise each other. In the books, characters often don’t recognise
[01:31:09] each other. Like, Theon and Asha don’t recognise each other. It shows how characters have changed,
[01:31:16] exploring themes of identity and perception. Arya is constantly not recognised by people. And
[01:31:22] she specifically worries that Jon won’t recognise her. And Jon wonders if he’ll recognise Arya.
[01:31:28] Jon has already met a fake Arya – he thought Alys was Arya, but she wasn’t. Ramsay’s wife Jeyne is
[01:31:35] another fake Arya. So when Jon finally meets the real Arya, he might think she’s another fake. They
[01:31:42] could recognise each other later, but the point could be that after everything that they’ve been
[01:31:47] through, Jon and Arya can’t have their happy innocent relationship ever again.
[01:31:54] So Winterfell might not be the happy homecoming Jon wanted. The Starks have changed,
[01:32:01] the family may be divided. Jon’s identity will still be uncertain, torn between the Starks,
[01:32:07] the Watch, the wildlings – and his hidden Targaryen identity haunting his dreams.
[01:32:14] Maybe Jon will abdicate as King in the North, and let Sansa rule instead. Cause
[01:32:20] Jon has more wars to fight. The white walkers are coming. And Daenerys will arrive with her
[01:32:27] dragons. In A Dream of Spring, Jon will fight the final battles of ice and fire.
[01:32:35] In the TV show, Jon and Daenerys fall in love. There are hints this’ll happen in the books,
[01:32:40] too – Daenerys has a vision of a blue flower on a wall of ice filling the air with sweetness – the
[01:32:48] flower could be Jon, because his mother Lyanna loved blue roses, and the sweetness could be
[01:32:53] Jon and Daenerys’ love. Jon and Dany have a lot in common. They’re both young leaders who want
[01:32:59] to protect people. They both want family and home. They’ve both suffered trauma and loss,
[01:33:05] and transformative magic. Jon is attracted to confident, capable women like Ygritte,
[01:33:12] like Val – like Dany. And Daenerys is attracted to bad boy warriors with great hair like Drogo
[01:33:19] and Daario. Jon may be more violent and have cooler hair after his resurrection. So it makes
[01:33:26] sense that Jon and Dany could fall in love. They also work as a political alliance – King Jon and
[01:33:32] Queen Daenerys could unite the north and south. Icy Jon and fiery Daenerys fit the series’ title,
[01:33:39] A Song of Ice and Fire. Daenerys’ dragons are the perfect weapon to destroy the army of the
[01:33:45] dead. So together they could burn the white walkers, get married, have babies, and rule
[01:33:50] Westeros happily ever after. What could go wrong? Jon will learn the truth about his parents – that
[01:33:59] he’s not Ned’s bastard, he’s the son of Lyanna Stark and Prince Rhaegar Targaryen.
[01:34:05] Jon is arguably the rightful King of Westeros. And if Rhaegar and Lyanna
[01:34:11] secretly got married like in the TV show, Jon is a trueborn Targaryen, not a bastard.
[01:34:17] There’re a few ways Jon could discover this. Howland Reed might tell Jon. Cause Howland
[01:34:22] was there when Jon was born, and George Martin has teased that Howland will be important. Or
[01:34:27] maybe Benjen will tell Jon about his parents. It would be more emotionally impactful for Jon
[01:34:33] to learn the truth from his beloved uncle. Benjen and Howland were both at the Harrenhal tourney,
[01:34:40] where Rhaegar and Lyanna probably got together, so they could tell Jon what
[01:34:44] his parents’ relationship was really like. Like in the TV show, Jon may learn this in
[01:34:49] the Winterfell crypts. Jon has those recurring dreams of the crypts, where he’s “searching for
[01:34:55] his father”, and he has to come down here. There are theories that Jon will find proof of his
[01:35:00] parents in the crypts – like Rhaegar’s harp, or a hidden message in Lyanna’s tomb. There
[01:35:06] are rumours of hidden dragon eggs in the crypts. Which could be a metaphor for Jon discovering his
[01:35:12] dragon identity. George uses the same metaphor with Egg ‘hatching’ into a Targaryen. And Jon
[01:35:19] discovering his identity in the stone crypts could fulfil the prophecy of a dragon waking
[01:35:25] from stone – Jon will enter the crypts as Ned’s bastard, and will emerge a Targaryen dragon.
[01:35:33] So what will the truth of his parents mean to him? Jon might be angry that Ned lied to him, that he
[01:35:40] was never a bastard. He might be horrified that his mother Lyanna was a teenager who died birthing
[01:35:46] him, and that Prince Rhaegar hooked up with her probably to fulfil a prophecy, sparking a war
[01:35:52] that killed thousands. Jon’s grandfather was the evil Mad King – that’s like finding out your dad
[01:36:00] is Darth Vader. And Jon’s lover Daenerys is his aunt – which is like finding out Princess Leia is
[01:36:06] your sister. It’s like poetry, it rhymes. In the TV show, Jon doesn’t want to be a
[01:36:12] Targaryen. But for this revelation to have meaning, it’s gotta have some impact on Jon.
[01:36:17] Cause Jon’s story is a search for identity. He felt rejected from the Starks, and that’s why
[01:36:24] he joined the Night’s Watch, why he was tempted by the wildlings, and by Stannis’ offer. Being
[01:36:29] a Targaryen could finally give Jon a family – he’d be royalty, alongside Queen Daenerys, with
[01:36:36] ancestral homes at King’s Landing and Dragonstone. In the show, Jon gets a new name, Aegon Targaryen.
[01:36:44] In the books, there’s already several Aegons, so Jon’s name might be Aemon or Jaehaerys Targaryen.
[01:36:50] Even as a child, Jon felt connected to Targaryens. He idolised King Daeron Targaryen. Maester Aemon
[01:36:58] Targaryen was Jon’s beloved mentor. And with Daenerys he could further explore his Targaryen
[01:37:04] side. Jon could bond with the dragon Rhaegal, who was named after Jon’s father Rhaegar. When
[01:37:10] Jon rides Rhaegal in flight, experiences that joy and power, he may embrace a Targaryen identity. In
[01:37:19] the books, there’s a magical connection between dragon and rider. Jon might start to have dragon
[01:37:24] dreams – visions of future triumph and doom. Cause dragons represent the intoxicating lure of power,
[01:37:33] of ambition and destruction. Dragons could wake the fire in Jon’s blood,
[01:37:39] connecting him to his Targaryen heritage and to Daenerys’ war for the Throne.
[01:37:45] In the TV show, Jon doesn’t want to be King of Westeros. But book Jon might want his rightful
[01:37:52] Throne. Because he’s always wanted justice, and to protect the innocent. With the wildlings,
[01:37:58] he learned a whole new political ideology of freedom and equality. And he has increasingly
[01:38:05] used political power to make change. In Book 5, he tries to unite the north to save the
[01:38:11] world – but he fails cause he doesn’t have enough power. If Jon took the Iron Throne
[01:38:18] as a Targaryen dragon king, maybe then he could unite the realm, save the world, and do justice.
[01:38:26] Much like Jon’s great-great-grandfather, King Egg, Aegon the Fifth. Egg also wanted to do justice and
[01:38:33] to protect the vulnerable, but he was frustrated by rebellions. So Egg tried to get dragons so he
[01:38:40] could use their power for good. But, in the end, Egg’s quest for dragons led to death and tragedy
[01:38:46] at Summerhall. Daenerys also seems headed for destruction, despite her good intentions. So
[01:38:54] like other Targaryens, Jon will be tempted by the power of fire and blood, embodied by his dragon
[01:39:00] Rhaegal. He’ll want to use this power for good – but he’ll see that dragons are destructive,
[01:39:07] they kill innocent people, “fire burns”. In the TV show, Daenerys fights a war against
[01:39:14] Cersei. But in the books, she might fight Young Griff, a “false dragon” who claims
[01:39:20] to be a Targaryen. Their war could be a new Dance of the Dragons – “And everywhere the
[01:39:27] dragons danced the people died”. Daenerys’ war will cause death and devastation. So Jon
[01:39:34] will ask himself – is it okay to kill innocent people to win the throne? He may be tempted to
[01:39:41] make sacrifices so he can rule. But Jon will also think of Ned Stark’s morality. Ned taught justice,
[01:39:48] mercy, to protect the innocent. Donal taught Jon empathy for common folk. The wildlings taught him
[01:39:54] the precious fleeting beauty of life. If Jon burns thousands to save the realm, what has he saved,
[01:40:02] and what has he become? This is a moral struggle, and it’s also a question of identity. Is Jon
[01:40:10] destined to be a fiery Targaryen because he has Rhaegar’s blood, or can he choose to be like Ned,
[01:40:16] the father who raised Jon? This is the song of ice and fire, the battle within Jon’s heart.
[01:40:25] Jon might also be tempted by Melisandre. In Book 5, Melisandre urges Jon to use her magic
[01:40:32] and visions. Jon doesn’t trust Melisandre at first, but throughout the book, she gradually
[01:40:37] wins him over. She makes a bunch of correct predictions – so in his last chapter, Jon wants
[01:40:43] to use Melisandre’s visions. When Jon is killed by “daggers in the dark”, and resurrected by
[01:40:50] Melisandre, that will prove her power even more. In the TV show, after Stannis dies, Melisandre
[01:40:56] says Jon is the prophesied hero Azor Ahai. TV Jon is not interested in the prophecy,
[01:41:03] but book Jon might listen. Cause book Jon reads about Azor Ahai. He dreams of fighting the dead
[01:41:09] with a flaming sword. After he’s reborn, as a fire wight, with the magic of R’hllor,
[01:41:16] he may believe he’s destined to save the world. Like Rhaegar did before him.
[01:41:22] So Jon may accept Melisandre’s help. She could help him understand the prophecy,
[01:41:27] and how to use its power. But unfortunately, her help often involves burning innocent people alive
[01:41:34] and killing your own brother with magic shadows. Her advice leads Stannis down a dark path that
[01:41:42] will probably destroy him. And Melisandre is often wrong about her visions – her power is
[01:41:49] treacherous. And her religion is dangerous. In the TV show, after Jon’s resurrection,
[01:41:55] Tormund says people think Jon is a “god”. Then the show drops that idea. But in the books, religion
[01:42:03] is increasingly important. The sparrows rise and imprison Queen Cersei. The eastern red priests say
[01:42:10] Daenerys is Azor Ahai, and demand a holy war. At Castle Black, Melisandre has religious followers,
[01:42:17] including Baratheon knights, and some Watch men and wildlings. So when Jon miraculously rises from
[01:42:24] the dead, he could be seen as a religious messiah. Fanatical followers could rally behind him, giving
[01:42:31] him the power to unite armies, to win wars. But the red god is hungry and jealous, demanding human
[01:42:39] sacrifice and the destruction of other religions. Daenerys might also ally with red priests. Which
[01:42:45] could lead to religious war in Westeros, between Jon and Dany with the red god, and Young Griff
[01:42:51] with the Faith of the Seven. If Jon uses the power of Melisandre and R’hllor, he’s playing with fire.
[01:42:59] So Jon will be torn between Targaryen R’hlloric fire power, and his icy Stark
[01:43:06] morality. And this war for his heart will climax when he faces the white walkers.
[01:43:13] While Jon is in the south, things will get bad at the Wall. The Night’s Watch could fall apart.
[01:43:19] Stannis is doomed. And the Wall will fall. In the TV show, the white walkers use a zombie dragon to
[01:43:27] break the Wall. In the books it might be Euron who breaks the Wall, with the Horn of Winter,
[01:43:32] or by stealing one of Dany’s dragons. But the Wall will fall, and the dead will march south.
[01:43:40] In the TV show, the battle against the white walkers lasts one night, one episode,
[01:43:45] at Winterfell. But in the books, this could be a long, grinding, apocalyptic conflict that ravages
[01:43:53] Westeros. The previous Long Night is said to have “lasted a generation” – years of cold
[01:43:59] and sunless skies, causing mass starvation. This darkness might be caused by a meteor
[01:44:06] strike – there are legends of fallen stars and comets associated with the Long Night. There
[01:44:12] are tales of the white walkers hunting humans with giant ice spiders as well as their zombie
[01:44:18] hordes. So the Long Night could be a dark magical apocalypse – “An age of wonder and terror”, “for
[01:44:27] gods and heroes”. The world will need a saviour. In the TV show, Arya kills the white walkers. But
[01:44:36] in the books, Jon is set up as the hero. He swore the Watch oath, he’s fought the dead,
[01:44:42] he’s had those prophetic dreams. So how will he stop the white walkers?
[01:44:48] In the TV show, the good guys all unite for a big battle and destroy the white walkers. But
[01:44:54] is this what the books are leading up to? George Martin criticises simplistic stories of good guys
[01:45:00] fighting bad guys – he said “We don’t need any more Dark Lords”. George writes morally complex
[01:45:09] conflicts. Where’s the moral challenge here? With the wildlings, Jon realised his enemies
[01:45:15] aren’t evil, so instead he made peace with them. Is it possible that Jon could also make peace with
[01:45:21] the white walkers? Jon wants to learn about the white walkers, wants to communicate with them.
[01:45:27] And in the books, the white walkers can talk, they have their own language, they make things out of
[01:45:33] ice. George calls them “beautiful”, “elegant”, “a different sort of life” – maybe the white walkers
[01:45:40] have a right to exist. In Book 5, Patrek jokes that Jon will offer the white walkers hospitality,
[01:45:47] will welcome them as guests. So maybe Jon will. There are theories that Jon won’t destroy the
[01:45:54] white walkers – that he’ll make a peace deal. It is possible to make agreements with the white
[01:46:01] walkers – like, Craster gives babies to the white walkers, and so they don’t attack him. And there’s
[01:46:07] the legend of the Night’s King. The Night’s King was a Commander of the Night’s Watch who married
[01:46:13] a cold woman with blue eyes, and made sacrifices to the white walkers. So there are theories that
[01:46:20] the previous Long Night ended not with a battle, but with a marriage pact, where the Night’s King
[01:46:25] married a wight, and the Watch agreed to give them babies. There are theories that the Starks are
[01:46:31] descended from the Night’s King and his queen. And that Jon is owed or promised to the white walkers,
[01:46:38] that they want him to become a new Night’s King. Maybe while Jon is dead, the white walkers will
[01:46:44] take over Jon’s body – just like they raised those wights in Book 1. Jon does have a dream
[01:46:50] where he’s armoured in ice – maybe his body will be influenced or marked by the white walkers.
[01:46:57] The Night’s King fell in love with a pale woman with blue eyes. So maybe the walkers
[01:47:02] will tempt Jon with a pale blue-eyed woman – like the wildling Val. In Book 5, Val wears
[01:47:09] a striking white outfit, with her blue eyes and a weirwood pin – if she dies, maybe she could become
[01:47:18] a zombie seductress to Jon. Jon might get visions from the white walkers telling him to marry her,
[01:47:24] that this is the only way to end the Long Night. Jon could become Lord Snow of the Nightfort – and
[01:47:32] by giving Val his magic seed, and sacrificing a few babies, he could make peace between the white
[01:47:38] walkers and humanity. This could be tempting. But marrying a zombie and sacrificing babies to demons
[01:47:46] is maybe not a good peace agreement – it’s a moral corruption, a deal with the devil. The Night’s
[01:47:54] King and Craster’s deals didn’t permanently stop the white walkers. Whatever temptation the
[01:48:01] white walkers offer, Jon should refuse them. Cause the white walkers may not be evil Dark
[01:48:08] Lords. But they’re also not misunderstood moral people. They seem more like a destructive force
[01:48:15] of nature, an imbalance in the seasons. They are a contrast to humanity, and a reason for humanity
[01:48:21] to unite. Unlike the petty destructive wars of lords, the war against the walkers really is
[01:48:29] worth fighting, for the survival of life itself. George Martin writes about the evil of war,
[01:48:37] but he says some wars are necessary, like stopping the Nazis in World War Two. So Jon should not make
[01:48:44] a deal with the white walkers. It’s prophesied that the hero must fight this darkness.
[01:48:52] The prophecy says that Azor Ahai, or the prince that was promised, will be reborn to lead the
[01:48:58] fight against the darkness. When Melisandre looks in her flames for a glimpse of Azor Ahai,
[01:49:03] she sees Jon “Snow”. As a Stark and a Targaryen, Jon is of ice and fire, and Rhaegar says of the
[01:49:10] hero that “his is the song of ice and fire”. Jon is literally a prince who was “promised”,
[01:49:18] when Ned promised Lyanna. It’s prophesied that Azor Ahai will be descended from Aerys,
[01:49:23] and Jon is Aerys’ grandson. It’s prophesied that Azor Ahai will wake dragons from stone, and Jon
[01:49:30] will wake his dragon identity in the stone crypts. It’s prophesied that Azor Ahai will be reborn
[01:49:37] beneath a bleeding star amidst smoke and salt. And there are bloody stars and smoke and salty
[01:49:45] tears when Jon is killed. It’s said Azor Ahai will wield a flaming sword called Lightbringer.
[01:49:52] This could be a metaphor for dragons. But it could also be a literal flaming sword. Undead Beric can
[01:49:59] light a sword on fire with his blood. So maybe undead Jon will light his sword on fire with his
[01:50:05] blood. It might be that the Dayne sword Dawn is the true Lightbringer, so maybe Jon will get Dawn
[01:50:11] and light it on fire to make it Lightbringer. It all fits – Jon could be Azor Ahai reborn. Daenerys
[01:50:19] also fits the prophecy, so Jon and Dany could both play a role. The original Azor Ahai forged
[01:50:27] Lightbringer by sacrificing his beloved wife. In the TV show, Arya destroys the white walkers
[01:50:34] by killing their leader, the Night King. In the books so far, there is no Night King. But
[01:50:40] Melisandre says the white walkers are controlled by the Great Other, the god of ice and darkness,
[01:50:47] “whose name may not be spoken”. This nameless white walker god sounds like the old gods,
[01:50:54] the gods of the weirwood trees, who are also described as “nameless”. In the show, and probably
[01:51:00] also in the books, the white walkers were created by the children of the forest with the magic of
[01:51:05] the old gods. And the white walkers are often associated with trees. So maybe the Great Other
[01:51:13] is some kinda evil offshoot of the old gods. In the TV show, we see a frozen weirwood tree, where
[01:51:19] the white walkers were created. In the books, Bran sees “the heart of winter”, which seems to
[01:51:25] be the centre of white walker power in the far far north. So maybe the Great Other is here,
[01:51:33] at the heart of winter, an evil spirit in a frozen tree, controlling the white walkers. And to defeat
[01:51:40] them, Jon has to destroy this tree. YouTuber David Lightbringer has videos on this theory.
[01:51:46] He points out that in the TV show, Beric stabs a spiral of corpses with his flaming sword, which
[01:51:52] could represent burning the spiral frozen tree. This could be Jon’s destiny – to destroy the
[01:52:00] Great Other, he must journey north. George Martin said that in the final books we’ll
[01:52:05] see further north than ever before. The journey could be similar to the legend of the last hero.
[01:52:12] The last hero “set out into the dead lands” with a “dragonsteel” sword and a dog and his friends,
[01:52:18] and got the help of the children of the forest to defeat the white walkers. Maybe Jon will journey
[01:52:23] north with his sword and his dog, guided by Bran’s magic. He could assemble an all-star team of
[01:52:29] badass rangers to join him, fighting the dead, dying one by one. For the final stretch north,
[01:52:36] beyond “the curtain of light at the end of the world”, Jon and Daenerys might fly north on their
[01:52:42] dragons. Maybe Jon will convince Daenerys that the war against the walkers is more important than
[01:52:48] her war for the Iron Throne – that their duty to the realm matters more than their desires.
[01:52:54] So Jon and Daenerys will face the heart of winter. And to destroy the white walkers, they’ll need to
[01:53:00] do more than just burn a tree. Cause the legends of Azor Ahai, and the themes of Jon’s story
[01:53:06] emphasise sacrifice, and tough moral choices. The original Azor Ahai killed his wife,
[01:53:13] as a sacrifice, to make the sword Lightbringer. So maybe Jon has to kill Daenerys to get her
[01:53:20] fire into his sword, to burn the Great Other. Maybe Dany will willingly offer her life to
[01:53:26] save the world. Will Jon kill his lover? Jon has made sacrifices. He sacrificed
[01:53:34] Ygritte to protect the realm. He took Gilly’s baby to save another. He risked
[01:53:39] the Night’s Watch to save Arya. This could be Jon’s ultimate choice between duty and
[01:53:45] love – will he kill Daenerys to save the world? Bloodraven and Melisandre might tell Jon it’s
[01:53:52] worth sacrificing one person for the world. That Jon must take this fiery power and rule
[01:53:59] as the last dragonlord. That it’s his destiny, because of the prophecy and his magic blood.
[01:54:06] But this series questions fantasy tropes like destiny, prophecy and special bloodlines. The
[01:54:13] magic Targaryen dynasty was often a disaster – their flawed personalities, and their dragons,
[01:54:19] caused terrible destruction. Special bloodlines put awful kings on the Throne,
[01:54:30] the whole feudal class system is a horrific injustice. The moral of this story is not that
[01:54:37] Jon deserves power because of his Targaryen blood. And prophecy often backfires – like at Summerhall,
[01:54:45] and with Rhaegar, and Stannis – “Prophecy will bite your prick off every time”.
[01:54:51] So Jon should not blindly follow prophecy. Especially not the prophecy of Azor Ahai – that
[01:54:57] dude killed his wife to get a sword. Is he really a hero? There’s a suspiciously similar legend
[01:55:04] about the evil Bloodstone Emperor, who killed the Amethyst Empress to steal her power. The
[01:55:11] legendary Grey King killed a female dragon and stole fire power. The Winged Knight married a
[01:55:19] child of the forest, who then died in childbirth, and he rode a dragon. All these legends are of a
[01:55:26] man who killed a woman and got magic power – and half these guys seem like evil tyrants,
[01:55:32] not saviours. It might be that the original Azor Ahai actually caused the Long Night,
[01:55:37] not ended it. Killing some magic woman might’ve been the original sin, the fire stolen from the
[01:55:44] gods, that unbalanced the cosmos in the first place. Whatever the original Azor Ahai did,
[01:55:50] it didn’t destroy the white walkers – they came back. So why should Jon repeat this cycle
[01:55:56] of violence by sacrificing Dany? This choice will define Jon’s morality, and his identity.
[01:56:04] Because Jon has the magic blood. He could fulfil the prophecy, sacrifice Dany, and rule. But what
[01:56:11] makes Jon special, what makes him a worthy hero, is not his blood, or a prophecy. Jon is a hero
[01:56:19] because of his choices. Jon learned humility and compassion at the Watch. He was raised as Ned
[01:56:27] Stark’s bastard, and Ned taught him justice, and mercy – Jon thinks of Ned when he spares Ygritte.
[01:56:34] He thinks of Ned when he spares that old man. Surely when Jon faces Dany at the heart of winter,
[01:56:40] he’ll again think of Ned, and will spare Dany. In Book 1, Ned himself tells Robert to not kill
[01:56:48] Daenerys. So now, Jon can do the same, he can become Ned’s true heir, by sparing Daenerys.
[01:56:56] He can reject the temptation of fiery power and prophecy, just as he rejects the white walkers,
[01:57:03] and instead make a human moral choice. Instead of killing Dany, Jon might sacrifice
[01:57:10] himself. Jon has often been willing to give his life for others. In Book 3,
[01:57:15] he thinks if he has to die to save the north, then that’s what he’ll do. Qhorin taught him that
[01:57:22] self-sacrifice is the meaning of the Night’s Watch oath. So after all Jon’s struggle with his vows,
[01:57:29] in the end, he can keep his oath, by giving his life to destroy the white walkers. Daenerys could
[01:57:35] stab Jon to forge Lightbringer. Or he could stab himself, impale himself on the frozen
[01:57:41] tree – giving up his fiery blood to burn the Great Other. A heroic self-sacrifice could be a
[01:57:51] fitting ending to Jon’s story. Like his dream of a glorious death in Book 1. It’s… almost… too easy.
[01:58:01] Here's another possibility – instead of killing himself or Daenerys, maybe Jon will sacrifice his
[01:58:09] dragon Rhaegal. Because Rhaegal represents Jon’s Targaryen side. Rhaegal gives him the power of
[01:58:16] fire and of flight. Rhaegal is named for Jon’s father, represents his legitimacy as a Targaryen
[01:58:23] king. If Jon kills Rhaegal, he gives up that power. In all the history and lore of this world,
[01:58:30] there are no examples of a dragonrider killing their own dragon. Because of the magic bond,
[01:58:37] it would be like killing part of yourself. Killing Rhaegal would be a profound sacrifice, and it
[01:58:43] could finally resolve Jon’s identity crisis. Jon could reject his destructive Targaryen side,
[01:58:51] and instead follow Ned Stark’s moral example – giving up his own power to save others. Cause
[01:58:59] Jon is not defined by his blood. He is not a Targaryen. He’s not even a Stark. He is Jon Snow,
[01:59:07] and he chooses to follow Ned’s moral example. Jon could stab Rhaegal with his sword,
[01:59:13] so the dragon’s fire goes into the blade, creating Lightbringer. Then he can stab the frozen tree,
[01:59:20] burning the Great Other, and destroying the white walkers. He’ll save the world, not by sacrificing
[01:59:28] others and seizing power, like Azor Ahai and Tywin and Ramsay and all the other monstrous
[01:59:34] men in this story. Instead Jon could make a human moral choice to save others. He’ll end the Long
[01:59:44] Night. But there’ll still be one more sad war. A Song of Ice and Fire is partly George Martin’s
[01:59:53] response to The Lord of the Rings, the classic fantasy story. Jon Snow is like Aragorn – they’re
[02:00:00] both warriors and leaders who fight to save the world. They both have tragic romances,
[02:00:05] both are secret heirs to the kingdom. But George questions Aragorn’s happy ending, where he
[02:00:11] marries the girl and rules well for a hundred years. Jon’s ending will be darker than that.
[02:00:18] George loves the bit at the end of the Lord of the Rings called the Scouring of the Shire.
[02:00:23] After the Dark Lord is defeated, the hobbits go home, and find there’s still evil in the
[02:00:29] world – Saruman took over the Shire, and there’s this sad ugly conflict to remove him. Frodo can’t
[02:00:37] live happily ever after, cause he’s wounded and traumatised, so instead he sails west – and
[02:00:44] magic fades from the world of men. It’s about the cost of victory, the impact of violence,
[02:00:51] and the inevitability of change. The heroes save the world, but at great cost. The ending is happy,
[02:00:59] but also sad – it’s bittersweet. George says the end of A Song of Ice and Fire will be similar.
[02:01:07] So Jon might also face a sad final conflict. Maybe he’ll come to King’s Landing so Daenerys
[02:01:14] can rule, but they’ll find Cersei on the throne – vindictively clinging to power, holding the city’s
[02:01:20] civilians hostage. Like in TV show, Daenerys will probably burn King’s Landing, killing thousands
[02:01:27] of innocent people. In the TV show, she does this deliberately, out of anger and madness,
[02:01:33] but in the books it might be accidental, because of the wildfire. Cersei, Tyrion or JonCon might
[02:01:41] also be involved. Maybe Daenerys will lose control of her dragon, and Drogon will burn the city
[02:01:47] against her will. Daenerys struggles to control Drogon in the books. In Hot D, Viserys says
[02:01:54] dragons cannot be controlled, they are inherently destructive. Like the icy white walkers, dragon
[02:02:01] fire is an apocalyptic threat to this world. So like in the TV show, Daenerys will win the
[02:02:07] Throne, but will be hated by the people and the lords. Visions hint that Young
[02:02:13] Griff will be popular. So after Daenerys burns him and burns King’s Landing, no one will want
[02:02:19] Dany to be queen. And they’ll want her dragon dead – like in the storming of the Dragonpit.
[02:02:26] So to bring peace to the realm, Jon might have to bring down Daenerys and kill her dragon.
[02:02:33] Daenerys sees her dragons as her children. They are her power, and her identity as a Targaryen
[02:02:38] dragon queen. After everything she’s lost, if her last dragon dies, she’ll have nothing. If
[02:02:45] Jon kills Drogon, she’d see that as the ultimate betrayal – that could be the prophesied third
[02:02:52] treason. But Jon may see that the realm can’t have peace while a dangerous dragon lives and while
[02:02:58] Daenerys has the throne. This will be another painful moral dilemma for Jon – will he betray
[02:03:06] his love to protect the realm? Make another tragic sacrifice, to save the world from fire,
[02:03:13] just as he saved it from ice? He will want Daenerys’ love, he will want to rule with her,
[02:03:20] but he’ll know that peace is more important than his desires. It will destroy Jon if he has to kill
[02:03:27] Daenerys. Maybe he could fake Daenerys’ death so she can escape to the east – tragically separating
[02:03:33] the lovers? There’s lots of possibilities. Maybe we’ll make a Real Daenerys video to
[02:03:39] explore her fate. But it makes sense that Jon will bring down Daenerys, and that her dragons
[02:03:44] will die. Cause in the books, dragons make magic stronger in the world. If the last dragon dies,
[02:03:52] magic could fade away. Like at the end of The Lord of the Rings. It’s the end of fantasy,
[02:03:58] and the beginning of a world more like our own. Another possibility is instead of killing Dany,
[02:04:05] Jon might have to kill King Bran. Cause Bran might be a sinister puppet of Bloodraven and
[02:04:12] the old gods – having a creepy inhuman tree wizard as king might be a bad thing. And George Martin’s
[02:04:19] original outline of the series said that Jon and Bran would become enemies. The old gods
[02:04:25] seem like a sinister force, manipulating humanity – so maybe, like the dragons and white walkers,
[02:04:31] they need to be destroyed. Jon might have to reluctantly kill his beloved brother Bran.
[02:04:39] Whether he kills King Bran or kills Daenerys, Jon will know he’ll be exiled for this murder.
[02:04:47] So this’ll be another self-sacrifice. Despite all his heroism, he won’t get
[02:04:52] to go home to Winterfell, or be a king. He won’t get love and glory – he might be hated,
[02:04:59] as a traitor and murderer. Jon will give up everything to save a world that rejects him.
[02:05:06] In Book 1, Benjen said Jon didn’t know what he was giving up by joining the Watch. But now,
[02:05:13] Jon has experienced love with Ygritte, and Dany. He’s experienced power at the
[02:05:19] Wall and on dragonback, tasted glory in battle. He’s no longer a boy, he’s a man, he’s lived,
[02:05:26] and now he understands what he’s giving up. That’s what makes his sacrifice meaningful.
[02:05:32] So like in the TV show, Jon may be exiled beyond the Wall. He’ll be separated from the Starks. He
[02:05:40] might get to join the wildlings – Tormund says he’ll make Jon a true wildling. Ygritte was right,
[02:05:46] Jon likes the free folk life. And he had always felt like an outcast, like the wildlings. Maybe
[02:05:53] Jon will finally get to be with Val, if she’s still alive. With the free folk,
[02:05:58] Jon would be free of war, of politics, of vows. But like Frodo, he’ll be wounded. After his death
[02:06:06] and resurrection, and his sacrifices, Jon won’t be whole. Maybe he’ll be a husk like Coldhands and
[02:06:14] Beric, unable to feel or enjoy life. Maybe zombie Jon will wander to that cave, where Ygritte wanted
[02:06:21] to stay. And there he’ll remain, with his memories of warmth, with his loves and losses, forever.
[02:06:30] George Martin loves fantasy – heroes, romance, and magic – but he sees that the real world is
[02:06:38] more complex. So his characters grow up, they are disillusioned, they learn that the world
[02:06:44] is not a fairy tale. Good and evil are not black and white, we can’t rely on prophesied
[02:06:52] princes to save the world. So in a complex real world, what does it mean to be a hero?
[02:07:00] Jon Snow is a deconstruction of the classic fantasy hero. Cause he is a secret prince, heir
[02:07:07] to the kingdom, prophesied to save the world – but will reject destiny, reject his birthright, reject
[02:07:14] the fantasy tropes. His heroism is realer and more human. Cause Jon struggles to do the right thing,
[02:07:22] he makes morally grey choices. He has doubts, temptation, conflicted desires, but he persists,
[02:07:29] he chooses to save others. That’s what makes him heroic. It’s not cause of prophecy or magic,
[02:07:36] but because people’s lives matter. In a complex cynical real world, that’s the heroism we need.
[02:07:45] At the end of this series, there’ll still be evil in the world, there’ll still be darkness
[02:07:49] and weakness in every heart. But Jon embodies the eternal human struggle
[02:07:55] for light in a dark world – a dream of spring. Thanks for watching. We’re making more videos

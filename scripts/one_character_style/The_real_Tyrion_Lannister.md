[00:00:11] Game of Thrones author George Martin said that he likes Tyrion Lannister.
[00:00:15] Tyrion is “the villain” of course – but there’s nothing like a good villain.
[00:00:22] The first few seasons of the Thrones TV show are a.. pretty close adaptation of the books
[00:00:26] – Tyrion is a smart, funny dwarf who uses his wits in politics, but feels rejected and
[00:00:33] unloved.
[00:00:34] When he’s condemned for a crime that he didn’t commit, he kills his father Tywin
[00:00:39] and his lover Shae.
[00:00:41] But after Season 4, Tyrion in the show becomes a totally different character to Tyrion in
[00:00:47] the books.
[00:00:48] In the show, Tyrion joins Daenerys cause he believes she will make the world better.
[00:00:52] He tries to help her take the Throne without killing innocent people, and without killing
[00:00:57] his siblings Cersei and Jaime.
[00:01:00] But Tyrion’s plans all fail.
[00:01:02] His peace in Meereen fails, his war plans fail, his Cersei deal fails [including his
[00:01:08] ludicrous wight hunt idea], and his plan for King’s Landing fails when Daenerys burns
[00:01:11] the city.
[00:01:12] Tyrion used to be a smart and ruthless political player, but he spends most of the last two
[00:01:18] seasons just standing around looking sad and helpless.
[00:01:23] In the finale he tells Jon to kill Dany, and he says Bran should be king, and everything’s
[00:01:30] sort of okay in the end.
[00:01:32] Tyrion’s story was about his use of political power, and his need for love and family.
[00:01:38] But the ending of the show doesn’t resolve these themes.
[00:01:42] He fails politically but.. still gets power.
[00:01:45] And his family dies and no one loves him, but he’s.. just kind of okay still.
[00:01:51] He doesn’t change or grow as a character, and he barely impacts the story apart from
[00:01:57] the thirty minutes.
[00:01:58] The final line of dialogue in Game of Thrones is Tyrion telling a joke, but we don’t hear
[00:02:04] the punchline.
[00:02:05] Which is a good metaphor for Tyrion’s story in the show – there’s a great set-up in
[00:02:09] the first few seasons, but there’s no punchline, no emotional payoff in the end.
[00:02:15] Because Tyrion in the show is not the real Tyrion Lannister.
[00:02:20] In the books, his story is very different, and much darker.
[00:02:25] After killing Tywin and Shae, Tyrion is traumatised,
[00:02:29] and angry.
[00:02:30] He doesn’t want to protect Cersei and Jaime, he wants to kill his siblings, for revenge.
[00:02:35] And he doesn’t want to protect innocent people – he wants to bring “fire and sword”
[00:02:40] to Westeros.
[00:02:42] He thinks of himself as a “vengeful ghost” coming to “haunt the Seven Kingdoms” – “They
[00:02:47] would not love me living, so let them dread me dead”.
[00:02:51] So what is Tyrion’s story in the books, and.. is Tyrion Lannister a villain?
[00:02:58] Tyrion in the books looks very different to Peter Dinklage in the show.
[00:03:03] Book-Tyrion is ugly – he has a “brutish” “squashed-in face”, he’s described as
[00:03:09] “grotesque” “like a gargoyle”.
[00:03:12] His hair is pale blond, and his eyes are two different colours – one green and one black.
[00:03:18] When Tyrion is wounded in battle, he doesn’t just get a cool scar – half his nose is
[00:03:23] cut off, leaving his face hideously “disfigured”.
[00:03:28] Tyrion’s ugliness is important because it’s part of why people reject him and see him
[00:03:33] as a monster.
[00:03:34] One of the inspirations behind Tyrion’s character is Richard the Third, who was a
[00:03:39] King of England in the Wars of the Roses.
[00:03:41] In histories and literature, Richard was portrayed as a devious villain who killed his family
[00:03:46] to gain power.
[00:03:48] And supposedly, Richard was ugly and deformed with a hunchback – his evil soul was reflected
[00:03:54] in an ugly twisted body.
[00:03:57] Modern historians doubt whether any of that was actually true about Richard.
[00:04:01] But the point is that because of Tyrion’s
[00:04:03] ugly appearance, people are prejudiced against him.
[00:04:06] Tyrion was rejected from the day he was born.
[00:04:11] Tyrion’s father Tywin was always proud and ambitious.
[00:04:15] But Tywin’s father Lord Tytos was weak – his lords mocked and laughed at him to his face.
[00:04:22] Young Tywin hated the humiliation and shame that this brought to their noble family.
[00:04:28] So Tywin fought “to restore the pride and power” of House Lannister, brutally exterminating
[00:04:34] whole families who rebelled against them.
[00:04:37] Tywin became Lord of Casterly Rock, and Hand of the King for Aerys Targaryen.
[00:04:41] Tywin married his cousin Joanna, and he loved her deeply – it’s said that only she saw
[00:04:47] the real Tywin beneath his cold harsh armour.
[00:04:52] They had twins, Cersei and Jaime – Tywin wanted Cersei to be queen, and Jaime a great
[00:04:58] knight – he dreamed they’d be “so strong and brave and beautiful that no one would
[00:05:03] ever laugh at them”.
[00:05:04] After the humiliation of his father Tytos, laughter was what Tywin hated most.
[00:05:10] But then, Joanna died giving birth to Tyrion – an ugly “malformed” dwarf.
[00:05:17] In the superstitious society of Westeros, people thought Tyrion’s birth was a dark
[00:05:18] omen foretelling disaster.
[00:05:18] King Aerys mocked Tywin, and said Tyrion was a punishment from the gods – that they took
[00:05:23] Tywin’s beautiful wife and gave him a monster to teach him humility.
[00:05:28] The smallfolk called Tyrion “Lord Tywin’s Doom”.
[00:05:33] So Tyrion’s birth hurt the two things Tywin loved most – it undermined the pride and
[00:05:39] dignity of House Lannister, and caused the death of his beloved wife.
[00:05:44] So Tywin always hated Tyrion, and was cold and cruel to him.
[00:05:49] Cersei copied her father and also hated Tyrion.
[00:05:53] The only immediate family who showed Tyrion any affection or respect was his brother Jaime.
[00:05:59] Jaime gave him toys, and taught him to ride a pony, and Tyrion loved and trusted Jaime
[00:06:04] more than anyone.
[00:06:06] He also liked his uncles Tygett and Gerion.
[00:06:09] Gerion taught Tyrion about the wonders of the world, and taught him acrobatics, like
[00:06:14] flips and walking on his hands.
[00:06:16] But Tywin hated Tyrion acting a fool, and being laughed at, so he stopped the acrobatics.
[00:06:23] Tywin also refused to let Tyrion travel the world with Gerion, and instead put him in
[00:06:28] charge of the drains and cisterns at Casterly Rock.
[00:06:32] So Tyrion had a lonely childhood, finding comfort in books about history and dragons.
[00:06:39] Rejected by his father and his sister, and with no mother, Tyrion desperately wanted
[00:06:45] to be loved.
[00:06:46] When Tyrion was thirteen, he met a common girl called Tysha.
[00:06:50] They fell in love, and got married, happily living as husband and wife for two weeks.
[00:06:55] But when Tywin found out, he was furious that Tyrion had shamed House Lannister by marrying
[00:07:01] an unworthy woman.
[00:07:03] Jaime told Tyrion that Tysha was a “whore” – that Jaime paid Tysha to be with Tyrion,
[00:07:09] and that she didn’t really love him.
[00:07:11] To teach Tyrion a lesson, Tywin had Tysha raped by his guards.
[00:07:17] Then he made Tyrion rape Tysha.
[00:07:20] And the marriage was ended.
[00:07:22] So the one time that Tyrion fell in love with someone, he learned that that love wasn’t
[00:07:28] real.
[00:07:29] He was betrayed, humiliated, and forced to violate and dehumanise his wife.
[00:07:36] Ever since Tysha, Tyrion believed that no woman would ever truly love him, that they’d
[00:07:42] only want him for his gold.
[00:07:44] So Tyrion turns to sex workers and wine.
[00:07:47] But Tyrion says that while whores will fuck you, they won’t kiss you – Tyrion craves
[00:07:52] real intimacy, and approval, and a place in the world.
[00:07:56] He’s not a warrior like Jaime.
[00:07:58] He doesn’t have power like Tywin.
[00:08:00] He’s not feared or loved.
[00:08:02] But he is smart.
[00:08:04] He’s good at strategy, and manipulating people.
[00:08:07] So Tyrion reads lots of books – he says his mind is his weapon, and his wits are all
[00:08:13] he has.
[00:08:15] When Tyrion is about 25 years old, Book 1
[00:08:18] begins.
[00:08:19] He goes up to Winterfell with King Robert and the rest, and he makes friends with Jon
[00:08:23] Snow.
[00:08:24] In the books, Tyrion does an acrobatic jump and somersault here, which author George Martin
[00:08:30] later said he.. “could have left out” cause it’s.. kinda silly.
[00:08:33] But Jon feels rejected from his family for being a bastard, just like Tyrion feels rejected
[00:08:39] for being a dwarf.
[00:08:40] So he gives Jon advice – he says when people make fun of you and call you names, you should
[00:08:46] take that name, and make it your armour.
[00:08:49] So like when people mock Tyrion and call him the Imp, Tyrion takes on the persona of a
[00:08:55] sarcastic cynical Imp.
[00:08:58] He uses jokes and irony as a shield to deflect the hurt of rejection.
[00:09:03] And he uses his sharp tongue to make fun of people back.
[00:09:07] Tyrion slaps Joffrey for being a dick.
[00:09:10] He stands up for Jon against the bullying Alliser Thorne, and defeats him in a mighty
[00:09:16] duel with a crab fork.
[00:09:18] Tyrion gives Bran a special saddle design, so he can ride a horse after his injury – Tyrion
[00:09:24] has sympathy for cripples, bastards and broken things, he identifies with outcasts and underdogs.
[00:09:32] But Tyrion can also be cruel and vindictive.
[00:09:36] Even in small ways.
[00:09:38] Like, he dislikes Benjen Stark, so Tyrion takes Benjen’s warm clothes to make Benjen
[00:09:43] cold, just out of petty spite.
[00:09:46] When Catelyn captures Tyrion, he plots revenge on all her men.
[00:09:51] He especially hates the singer Marillion for making fun of him.
[00:09:54] So when they’re attacked, Tyrion stomps on Marillion’s hand, and breaks his fingers
[00:10:00] – just cause he’s annoyed by this guy’s singing!
[00:10:03] Lysa falsely accuses Tyrion of murder.
[00:10:06] And it’s easy to frame Tyrion, because he’s an ugly Imp, and people are biased against
[00:10:11] him.
[00:10:12] But Tyrion escapes using his wits and his words – he convinces Bronn, and the mountain
[00:10:18] clansmen to join him.
[00:10:20] Tyrion says he’ll help the mountain clansmen attack the Vale.
[00:10:23] And in the books, he’s serious about this.
[00:10:26] He plans “to reduce the Vale of Arryn to a smoking wasteland”.
[00:10:31] He thinks there’s nothing he’d enjoy more than getting revenge on Lysa, “except perhaps
[00:10:36] strangling Cersei”.
[00:10:38] He often fantasises about killing Cersei and Tywin.
[00:10:42] Even as a child, he dreamed of burning his sister and father in dragonfire.
[00:10:48] So from the beginning, book--Tyrion has a dark side that wasn’t in the TV show.
[00:10:54] Being mistreated and disrespected makes him angry, and he wants to pay his debts with
[00:11:01] violent revenge.
[00:11:03] Tyrion meets with his father Tywin as the Lannisters go to war with the Starks and Tullys.
[00:11:09] And Tywin fights this war in the most violent and destructive way possible.
[00:11:14] He orders his most brutal soldiers like the Mountain to burn and plunder the riverlands,
[00:11:19] killing and raping innocent people.
[00:11:22] And Tyrion doesn’t question this.
[00:11:24] He’s there when Tywin gives the orders.
[00:11:27] He sees villages burned, and sees innocent people killed by his family.
[00:11:32] And Tyrion has no sympathy – because Tyrion thinks like Tywin.
[00:11:38] It was Tywin who taught Tyrion that a Lannister pays his debts with brutal indiscriminate
[00:11:43] violence – “I see you have taken a few lessons from me” Tywin says.
[00:11:48] And that’s why Tyrion wants violent revenge on Marillion, the Vale, and ironically, on
[00:11:54] Tywin.
[00:11:55] Tyrion does hate Tywin, but he’s still desperate for his father’s love and approval, so he’s
[00:12:01] internalised Tywin’s brutal methods, and tries to be like him.
[00:12:05] But no matter how hard Tyrion tries, Tywin just criticises and humiliates Tyrion, saying
[00:12:11] he’s weak and useless.
[00:12:13] Tywin’s constant negging makes Tyrion feel insecure, inadequate, and unloved.
[00:12:20] Tywin orders Tyrion to fight on the front lines of a battle, and Tyrion realises that
[00:12:25] his father wants to get him killed.
[00:12:28] So before the battle, Tyrion feels lonely, and he meets a girl called Shae, who agrees
[00:12:33] to be his lover, in return for gold.
[00:12:36] Shae is just eighteen years old in the books.
[00:12:40] She’s witty and charming, and when they have sex, she acts like she enjoys it and
[00:12:45] calls him her “giant of Lannister”.
[00:12:48] Tyrion knows she’s just pretending to like him, but he’s so desperate for love that
[00:12:53] he wants to believe that it’s real.
[00:12:56] In the TV show, Shae eventually does love Tyrion for real.
[00:13:00] But not in the books.
[00:13:02] Author George Martin says Shae doesn’t give a shit about Tyrion, and is only in it for
[00:13:07] the money and status.
[00:13:08] And Tyrion knows this, but after his experience with Tysha, he feels that fake love is all
[00:13:15] he can get.
[00:13:16] At the battle, in the TV show, Tyrion gets knocked out and misses the whole thing – because
[00:13:21] the showrunners didn’t have the budget for a battle in Season 1.
[00:13:25] But in the books, Tyrion rides in and fights – he kills some blokes, and stabs a horse
[00:13:30] with his hat, and he survives this battle.
[00:13:33] So [now that Jaime has been captured] Tywin gives Tyrion a hint of praise and respect
[00:13:37] for once.
[00:13:37] He tells Tyrion to go to King’s Landing and rule as Hand of the King.
[00:13:42] But Tywin also tells Tyrion not to bring his “whore” Shae.
[00:13:46] The talk of whores brings up Tyrion’s anger and pain for what Tywin did to Tysha.
[00:13:52] So Tyrion defies his father and brings Shae to King’s Landing.
[00:13:57] So in Book 1, Tyrion is hurt and angry at world that rejects him.
[00:14:03] He wants love, and respect, and revenge.
[00:14:07] In Book 2, Tyrion takes power in King’s
[00:14:10] Landing, and he says he’s going to do “justice”.
[00:14:13] He gets rid of the corrupt [gold cloak commander] Janos Slynt, because Janos’ men killed a
[00:14:17] baby and her mother.
[00:14:19] Tyrion imprisons and humiliates Pycelle for disobeying him.
[00:14:23] Tyrion blackmails Lancel Lannister, and bribes the Kettleblacks to spy on Cersei.
[00:14:28] He sends Myrcella to marry a Martell, and makes a plan to free Jaime from the Starks.
[00:14:34] Tyrion feels very impressed with himself for his clever political plots – he thinks he
[00:14:40] “can scheme with any man”, that this is what he was made for.
[00:14:44] But he’s not really as successful he thinks.
[00:14:48] Like sure, Tyrion outsmarts Janos and Pycelle and Lancel, but those guys are small fry – the
[00:14:54] real dangerous players are Littlefinger and Varys, and Tyrion never figures out what they’re
[00:14:59] up to.
[00:15:00] And many of Tyrion’s plots fail.
[00:15:03] The Kettleblacks were working for Littlefinger all along, not Tyrion.
[00:15:07] Myrcella’s marriage just lets the Martells use her against the Lannisters.
[00:15:11] Tyrion’s plot to free Jaime fails.
[00:15:14] And Tyrion’s insults to Pycelle, and Joffrey and Cersei and the Kingsguard and others just
[00:15:19] create enemies who turn against Tyrion in the end.
[00:15:22] So Tyrion is not as clever as he thinks he is.
[00:15:26] And he doesn’t really do justice.
[00:15:29] Like, sure, he gets rid of Janos Slynt, or just makes him Jon Snow’s problem, but the
[00:15:34] person who ordered Janos to kill a baby was Cersei, and Tyrion feels he can’t bring
[00:15:39] her to justice.
[00:15:40] Tyrion also realises that his own men, like Bronn, are just as cutthroat and immoral as
[00:15:46] Janos was.
[00:15:48] So he admits to himself that he isn’t really doing justice.
[00:15:52] Ultimately, Tyrion works as Hand of the King for King Joffrey, a cruel incompetent child
[00:15:58] tyrant.
[00:15:59] Tyrion knows that Joffrey is a terrible king.
[00:16:02] And he knows that he isn’t the rightful king – he’s a bastard of incest, making
[00:16:07] Stannis the true king.
[00:16:08] Tyrion knows that Cersei and Tywin are cruel terrible rulers.
[00:16:13] And he knows that their army commits evil atrocities in the riverlands.
[00:16:17] A river lord says that Lannister soldiers are burning, raping and killing innocent people.
[00:16:23] And Tyrion doesn’t care, he says that’s just war.
[00:16:27] Which is a bullshit excuse.
[00:16:29] The Starks and Tullys and Stannis don’t wage war like that – the Lannisters are
[00:16:34] exceptionally brutal.
[00:16:36] In between Tyrion’s chapters, we get chapters from Arya’s perspective, as she experiences
[00:16:41] the horror of Lannister atrocities – making it really clear that Tyrion is on the wrong
[00:16:47] side of this war.
[00:16:48] All his clever political plots support a brutal illegitimate government, fighting against
[00:16:55] the heroic Starks and righteous Stannis.
[00:16:58] Tyrion also mostly ignores the threat of the white walker apocalypse, even though the Night’s
[00:17:03] Watch repeatedly asks him for help.
[00:17:05] Tyrion doesn’t do justice in Book 2.
[00:17:09] It’s not about the realm.
[00:17:11] It’s about his ego.
[00:17:14] After a lifetime of being mocked and disrespected, Tyrion loves having power and status.
[00:17:20] He thinks “me, the dwarf, the monster, the one they scorned and laughed at”, “now
[00:17:26] I hold it all, the power, the city, the girl”, and “I do love it”.
[00:17:32] Tyrion’s humiliation of Lancel and Pycelle isn’t about political strategy.
[00:17:38] It’s about making himself feel powerful, making himself feel tall.
[00:17:43] Tyrion’s feelings of resentment are understandable and sympathetic.
[00:17:47] But he uses his power to bully and humiliate, to feed his ego, and to fight on the wrong
[00:17:54] side of this war.
[00:17:56] That’s why Tyrion is “the villain” in Book 2.
[00:18:00] Throughout the book, Tyrion struggles for power with Cersei.
[00:18:04] They’re both on team Lannister.
[00:18:08] But they each want the power for themselves.
[00:18:11] So they undermine and lie and insult and spy on each other.
[00:18:15] There is one moment when Tyrion and Cersei celebrate and are happy together, but Tyrion
[00:18:20] uses this opportunity to slip Cersei a mild poison, to get rid of her for a few days.
[00:18:26] And the relationship really breaks down when Tyrion gets between Cersei and her children.
[00:18:32] Tyrion sends Myrcella to Dorne.
[00:18:34] He takes Tommen away for safekeeping.
[00:18:37] And he puts Joffrey in a battle.
[00:18:39] Cersei feels that her children are threatened, so she retaliates by threatening the people
[00:18:44] Tyrion loves.
[00:18:45] She captures a sex worker called Alayaya, thinking that she’s Tyrion’s lover Shae.
[00:18:50] And she threatens to torture and kill the girl if Cersei’s children are hurt.
[00:18:55] So how does Tyrion react?
[00:18:58] He could just tell Cersei the truth – that she’s got the wrong girl, that Tyrion would
[00:19:03] never hurt her children, that they’re on the same side and shouldn’t fight – but
[00:19:08] instead, Tyrion decides to be like Tywin, and to speak with “his father’s voice”.
[00:19:15] Tyrion says if Alayaya is beaten and raped, Tyrion will beat and rape Tommen.
[00:19:21] He promises to hurt Cersei, to turn her joy to ashes in her mouth.
[00:19:28] This is the moment Tyrion and Cersei become enemies.
[00:19:32] And it happens because instead of being honest decent people, they both act like their brutal
[00:19:39] ruthless father.
[00:19:40] Their petty sibling rivalry for Tywin’s love spirals into murder, hate, and eventual
[00:19:47] disaster for their family.
[00:19:50] Tyrion defends King’s Landing from Stannis.
[00:19:54] He blows up Stannis’ ships with wildfire, and in the books he traps the burning ships
[00:19:59] with a giant chain.
[00:20:01] We see from Davos’ perspective as Tyrion’s wildfire kills his sons, and thousands of
[00:20:07] others – so from Davos’ perspective, Tyrion is totally the villain.
[00:20:13] Tyrion leads an attack, and fights amidst fiery ships like a badass.
[00:20:17] But then Tyrion’s attacked by one of
[00:20:19] his own men – Mandon Moore slashes Tyrion’s face open – possibly under Cersei’s orders,
[00:20:26] or Joffrey’s, or Littlefinger’s.
[00:20:30] But Tyrion goes down, and Tywin and the Tyrells arrive to win the battle.
[00:20:35] At the end of the book, Tyrion is badly wounded, his face is disfigured, and he’s alone.
[00:20:41] He has fever dreams and visions of the thousands of people he killed in battle, burned corpses
[00:20:48] weeping and moaning.
[00:20:50] He thinks “Why did I kill them all?”
[00:20:52] And then he dreams the answer – he dreams of a feast where everyone praises him as a
[00:20:58] hero, Jaime makes him a knight, Shae embraces him – and his father Tywin smiles with “approval”.
[00:21:07] This is why Tyrion fought this war, and played politics.
[00:21:12] It’s because he wants to be loved.
[00:21:15] But in Book 3, Tyrion gets no love.
[00:21:19] Tywin takes all the credit for winning the battle, and takes Tyrion’s power as Hand
[00:21:24] of the King.
[00:21:25] Tyrion’s allies are replaced and scattered, and Tyrion feels abandoned.
[00:21:30] So Tyrion goes to his father and asks for some “gratitude” and recognition for saving
[00:21:36] the city, and bleeding for their family.
[00:21:38] He asks to be publicly acknowledged as Tywin’s son and heir – since Jaime is a Kingsguard,
[00:21:44] Tyrion should be the next Lord of Casterly Rock.
[00:21:48] But Tywin refuses.
[00:21:50] He calls Tyrion an ill-made “creature”, “devious”, “spiteful” and full of
[00:21:56] lust.
[00:21:56] He says he’ll never let Tyrion turn Casterly Rock into his “whorehouse”.
[00:22:03] Tywin is angry that Tyrion threatened Cersei to protect Alayaya.
[00:22:07] So Tywin has Alayaya whipped, and kicked out the city gates naked.
[00:22:12] Tywin brings up Tysha, and Shae, and says he’ll kill Tyrion’s whores.
[00:22:19] So Tywin’s hatred of Tyrion is connected to Tywin’s feelings about women and sex,
[00:22:26] which goes back to Tywin’s relationship with his own father, Tytos.
[00:22:30] Cause after Tywin’s mother died, Tytos took common women as his mistresses.
[00:22:36] One mistress became proud and influential, ordering people around at the Rock.
[00:22:41] And she wore Tywin’s mother’s clothes and jewellery.
[00:22:45] Tywin was furious that a lowborn woman had power and status in House Lannister, and had
[00:22:52] impinged on the memory of his mother.
[00:22:55] So when Tytos died, Tywin stripped the woman, and walked her naked through the streets to
[00:23:00] show the world she was a “whore”.
[00:23:03] Now, Tywin does the same thing with Alayaya, and did something similar with Tysha.
[00:23:09] So because of his own daddy issues, Tywin is paranoid and insecure about lower-class
[00:23:14] women undermining his pride, so he uses brutal sexual violence and public humiliation to
[00:23:24] put women beneath the dignity of his noble house.
[00:23:28] So Tywin hates that Tyrion openly has sex with lowborn women like Tytos did.
[00:23:34] He hates that Tyrion is mocked and laughed at, like Tytos was.
[00:23:39] Tywin says “I was made to suffer my father’s follies.
[00:23:43] I will not suffer yours”.
[00:23:45] Tyrion reminds Tywin of all his deepest insecurities
[00:23:49] about his father and women and his grief for
[00:23:52] his wife.
[00:23:52] And it’s not fair, or rational, but that’s why Tywin hates Tyrion, and rejects him so
[00:23:59] brutally.
[00:24:01] Tyrion knows that Shae is in danger from Tywin, and it’d be safer to send her away.
[00:24:06] But she’s the only person who makes him feel loved.
[00:24:10] Even though he knows she’s just using him for his money.
[00:24:14] Shae is not a nice person in the books.
[00:24:17] She says cruel things about Lollys, a disabled rape victim.
[00:24:22] And Tyrion isn’t nice to Shae sometimes.
[00:24:25] He slaps her, he isolates and controls her, he risks the life of this teenage girl for
[00:24:32] his gratification.
[00:24:33] And then Tyrion gets in another shitty relationship
[00:24:36] with a teenager.
[00:24:38] Tywin tells Tyrion to marry Sansa Stark, so that the Lannisters can use her claim to take
[00:24:44] over the north.
[00:24:45] And Tyrion has mixed feelings.
[00:24:48] He says Sansa is “too young” to marry – cause she’s just twelve years old in
[00:24:53] the books – but Tyrion would like to rule Winterfell, and get away from his family.
[00:24:59] Tyrion offers for Sansa to marry Lancel instead, but Sansa remembers that Tyrion was kind to
[00:25:04] her once, and she hasn’t really got a choice, so they go along with the wedding.
[00:25:10] Sansa refuses to kneel for the wedding cloak though, so Tyrion has to stand on the back
[00:25:15] of a jester.
[00:25:17] The wedding is humiliating and depressing for them both.
[00:25:21] Tyrion gets drunk and threatens King Joffrey.
[00:25:25] Then they go to bed.
[00:25:27] Tywin told Tyrion to have sex with Sansa to consummate the marriage and secure her claim
[00:25:33] on the north.
[00:25:34] And at first, Tyrion intends to have sex with her.
[00:25:37] But Sansa doesn’t want him, so he relents, and they settle into their distant uncomfortable
[00:25:44] marriage.
[00:25:45] Tyrion tries to connect with her – he’s so desperate for love and validation, but
[00:25:51] she doesn’t want him, cause she’s twelve, and she’s a political prisoner, and Tyrion’s
[00:25:56] family killed her family.
[00:25:58] So their marriage is “a daily agony”.
[00:26:01] Tywin keeps telling Tyrion to have sex with Sansa, and Tyrion’s angry that his father
[00:26:06] keeps trying to control his sex life.
[00:26:08] A singer blackmails Tyrion, so Tyrion has him killed and made into soup.
[00:26:14] Tyrion’s stressed – he has a shitty job as master of coin, there’re Martells and
[00:26:20] Tyrells to deal with.
[00:26:21] His child wife hates him, his dad wants to kill his girlfriend, the queen hates him,
[00:26:27] the king hates him, the common people hate him and think he’s “a twisted little monkey
[00:26:32] demon”.
[00:26:32] House Lannister is more powerful than ever, but Tyrion feels miserable and alone.
[00:26:40] At Joffrey’s wedding, there’s a performance by some dwarfs, who ride a dog and a pig and
[00:26:45] joust for entertainment.
[00:26:47] Joffrey tells Tyrion to ride the pig, and Tyrion refuses, so they get angry and insult
[00:26:53] each other publicly.
[00:26:55] Then Joffrey dies of poisoned wine, and Cersei accuses Tyrion of the murder.
[00:27:01] At the trial, Tyrion has no friends to defend him – Bronn gets bribed by Cersei, and Podrick
[00:27:08] is just a boy.
[00:27:10] What Tyrion does have is a lot of enemies.
[00:27:13] All the people Tyrion threatened and humiliated over the last two books come back to condemn
[00:27:19] him.
[00:27:20] And they make a strong case that Tyrion poisoned Joffrey, because Tyrion did steal poison,
[00:27:26] and he did threaten Joffrey – he publicly swore to geld Joffrey.
[00:27:31] Of course, Tyrion didn’t really intend to cut off his nephew’s penis.
[00:27:36] Just like he didn’t really want to hurt Tommen.
[00:27:39] He only made these threats because he was angry and hurt, and cause he thought that
[00:27:44] acting like Tywin, and playing the role of a monster would protect him, like armour.
[00:27:50] But it doesn’t work.
[00:27:53] Tyrion says he’s been “on trial for being a dwarf” all his life.
[00:27:58] And it’s true that people are horribly prejudiced against him for the way he looks.
[00:28:02] But it’s also true that Tyrion’s villainous behaviour – his threats manipulation and
[00:28:08] lies – are part of why people treat him like a villain.
[00:28:13] Finally, Shae testifies against Tyrion, after being bribed and pressured by Cersei.
[00:28:19] Shae says Tyrion is guilty, and humiliates him by talking about their sex life.
[00:28:25] This betrayal breaks Tyrion, and all his hatred pours out.
[00:28:30] He says he wants to poison everyone, that he wishes he was the monster they think he
[00:28:35] is.
[00:28:36] Tyrion demands trial by combat, but the Mountain kills Oberyn, so Tywin condemns his son to
[00:28:43] death for a crime he didn’t commit.
[00:28:46] Before his execution, Tyrion is saved by Jaime.
[00:28:50] And this is the moment when Tyrion in the show and Tyrion in the books go in completely
[00:28:56] different directions.
[00:28:57] Cause in the show, Tyrion thanks Jaime, and they hug lovingly, then Tyrion leaves.
[00:29:03] But in the books, Jaime makes a terrible revelation.
[00:29:08] After Tyrion married Tysha, Jaime had told him that Tysha was a whore – that Jaime
[00:29:14] paid her to be with Tyrion, and she didn’t really love him.
[00:29:17] But now Jaime reveals that that was a lie that Tywin made him tell.
[00:29:22] Jaime didn’t pay Tysha, she was just a random peasant girl who really did love Tyrion.
[00:29:31] All these years, Tyrion thought that no woman would ever love him.
[00:29:35] But now he finds out that his wife, who was gang-raped by Tywin’s men, and by Tyrion,
[00:29:41] was the only woman who ever loved him.
[00:29:45] Tyrion is devastated, and furious that Jaime kept to this lie.
[00:29:50] It feels like the ultimate betrayal from the one person Tyrion thought he could trust.
[00:29:55] All Tyrion’s pain becomes rage, and he swears to get revenge on his family, to punish the
[00:30:02] world by becoming the villain they think he is – he says “I am the monster they all
[00:30:09] say I am”.
[00:30:10] Just to hurt Jaime, he says he did kill Joffrey, and tells him that Cersei’s been cheating
[00:30:16] on him.
[00:30:17] So Tyrion leaves Jaime not as a loving brother, but as his enemy, a monster wanting revenge.
[00:30:25] And it’s because of the revelation about Tysha that Tyrion goes after Tywin.
[00:30:31] And in Tywin’s bed, Tyrion finds Shae.
[00:30:36] Tywin had always criticised Tyrion for having sex with “whores”.
[00:30:41] He says it’s a weakness, and a shame on their family.
[00:30:45] After Tywin’s wife died, he supposedly never touched a woman – he “had no use for whores”.
[00:30:53] Tywin acted like he had no lust, no emotions, just cold rationality.
[00:30:58] But now Tyrion sees that’s a lie.
[00:31:02] Tywin does have sex, just like Tyrion.
[00:31:06] And it’s not just Shae.
[00:31:08] In Book 2, Tyrion uses a secret tunnel that runs into a brothel.
[00:31:13] Varys says that this tunnel was built for a Hand of the King so he could visit the brothel
[00:31:18] secretly.
[00:31:18] And inside the brothel is a “red and yellow” window, and “a globe of gilded metal and
[00:31:25] scarlet glass” – those are Lannister colours, red and gold.
[00:31:28] And Tywin Lannister was Hand of the King.
[00:31:31] So it was probably Tywin who built this tunnel to visit the brothel on the regular.
[00:31:36] Tywin even lets Shae wear his jewellery, just like his father’s mistress wore his mother’s
[00:31:42] jewellery.
[00:31:43] So there are some deep dark complicated feelings about sex and family and shame happening in
[00:31:50] Tywin.
[00:31:51] But the point is that Tyrion discovers that Tywin is a massive hypocrite who does have
[00:31:57] sex with “whores” just like he does.
[00:32:00] In the show, when Tyrion finds Shae, Shae grabs a knife, and they struggle, before Tyrion
[00:32:07] kills her.
[00:32:08] Then he cries, and apologises to her corpse.
[00:32:12] The show tries to make the scene feel tragic, almost sympathetic to Tyrion.
[00:32:17] But in the books, it’s cold-blooded murder.
[00:32:21] Shae doesn’t grab a knife.
[00:32:23] Shae cries, and says she didn’t want to betray Tyrion, that Cersei made her, and Tywin
[00:32:30] scares her.
[00:32:31] But Tyrion is angry at her betrayal, so he strangles her to death without mercy.
[00:32:40] Compared to the show, this is a much more brutal, evil murder – author George Martin
[00:32:45] calls it his “blackest deed”, “the great crime of his soul”.
[00:32:51] Then Tyrion gets a crossbow and finds his noble father on the toilet.
[00:32:57] He asks Tywin what happened to Tysha – where did she go after the gang-rape?
[00:33:02] Tywin doesn’t know and doesn’t care, he says Tysha went “Wherever whores go”.
[00:33:09] So Tyrion shoots his father.
[00:33:12] Tywin says Tyrion is “no son of mine”, but Tyrion says “I’m you writ small”
[00:33:18] – meaning ‘I’m just like you’.
[00:33:21] Cause Tywin hates Tyrion for being devious, spiteful, and lustful.
[00:33:26] But it turns out, Tywin is just as devious spiteful and lustful as Tyrion.
[00:33:32] Tywin is devious when he plots the Red Wedding.
[00:33:36] He was spiteful when he killed Elia Martell, and the Reynes and Castameres.
[00:33:41] And he’s so goddamn lustful that he roots his son’s girlfriend and builds a secret
[00:33:46] personal sex tunnel to a brothel.
[00:33:49] Tywin and Tyrion have the same insecurities about being laughed at and feeling weak and
[00:33:55] ashamed.
[00:33:56] Tywin tries to hide his feelings behind the image of a noble rational golden lion, someone
[00:34:03] who’s above the petty shameful behaviour of his dwarf son.
[00:34:08] But it’s a lie.
[00:34:09] It’s all bullshit, and that’s why Tywin dies shitting himself on the toilet.
[00:34:14] Tywin “did not, in the end, shit gold”.
[00:34:18] Because he’s not a golden lion.
[00:34:20] He is a deeply flawed man full of shame and spite and lust, just like his son Tyrion.
[00:34:29] In Book 3, Tyrion tries be loved by his family and Shae and Sansa, but he is betrayed and
[00:34:37] condemned by everyone close to him.
[00:34:41] In Book 5, Tyrion goes east, drinking his way across the sea.
[00:34:46] He is consumed with self-loathing, anger, and despair – he’s lost everything.
[00:34:54] He no longer dreams of love or justice – all he has left is hatred.
[00:35:00] He wants to kill Jaime and Cersei, and bring war to Westeros, he wants to punish the world
[00:35:06] for rejecting him.
[00:35:07] And he especially hates women.
[00:35:10] Tyrion threatens a slave, saying he’ll have sex with her and murder her, just for the
[00:35:16] pleasure of making her afraid.
[00:35:19] Tyrion’s in a very dark place, and he reacts to his trauma and pain by hurting others and
[00:35:26] himself.
[00:35:28] In Pentos, Tyrion meets Illyrio, who’s working with Varys to help Daenerys conquer Westeros.
[00:35:34] He convinces Tyrion to join Daenerys, so that Tyrion can get revenge on the Lannisters,
[00:35:40] and take Casterly Rock for himself.
[00:35:42] So Tyrion travels with a group of Illyrio’s allies, led by this guy Griff, and this kid
[00:35:48] Young Griff.
[00:35:49] There’s also a septa, and a scholar, and a knight.
[00:35:53] And Tyrion figures out that Griff and his crew are not who they seem.
[00:35:57] Griff is actually Jon Connington, who was once a lord in Westeros.
[00:36:02] And Young Griff is actually supposedly Aegon Targaryen, the son of Prince Rhaegar and Elia
[00:36:09] Martell who everyone thought was dead.
[00:36:11] Griff and Illyrio and Varys have raised Aegon to be King – they hope to marry him to Daenerys
[00:36:17] so they can conquer and rule Westeros together.
[00:36:22] So they travel downriver and see some wondrous sights – there’s a giant turtle, a naked
[00:36:29] nun, and a strange shape in the fog that may or may not be a dragon.
[00:36:35] In the Sorrows, they see the ancient ruins of the Bridge of Dream and the Palace of Love,
[00:36:41] just like Tyrion’s dreams and loves are now ruined – which is one of George Martin’s
[00:36:46] less.. subtle metaphors.
[00:36:48] The Sorrows are a strange and spooky place, said to be ruled by a dark, mystical figure
[00:36:54] called the Shrouded Lord.
[00:36:56] Their boat inexplicably magically goes through the same place twice(?!), and then they’re
[00:37:02] attacked by stone men – people infected with greyscale.
[00:37:07] Tyrion saves Aegon, Jon Connington saves Tyrion, and JonCon gets infected with greyscale, but
[00:37:14] keeps it a secret – in the TV show, Jorah gets greyscale, but in the books it’s JonCon.
[00:37:20] And the disease makes JonCon desperate to make Aegon King of Westeros ASAP – because
[00:37:26] JonCon was in love with Aegon’s father, Prince Rhaegar.
[00:37:29] He feels guilty for failing Rhaegar, and wants to redeem himself by getting Aegon on the
[00:37:35] Throne.
[00:37:35] He and his crew have spent years training and protecting Aegon in secret, and now it’s
[00:37:41] almost time to reveal him and claim his birthright.
[00:37:45] But Tyrion.. really doesn’t give a fuck about JonCon and Aegon’s quest.
[00:37:51] He makes fun of Aegon’s story as a perfect handsome fantasy prince, and he undermines
[00:37:58] their noble heroism with his sarcasm and cynicism and hate.
[00:38:03] It’s almost.. meta how Tyrion mocks the fantasy tropes of the story that he’s in,
[00:38:09] like Rick Sanchez being so depressed and disillusioned
[00:38:13] and drunk that he breaks the fourth wall a
[00:38:15] little.
[00:38:16] Tyrion even dresses in motley like a jester – a villainous fool who makes fun of the
[00:38:23] world like an edgy Westerosi Joker.
[00:38:26] Tyrion hates JonCon because he reminds him of Tywin.
[00:38:30] And Aegon is an annoying hot-headed teenager.
[00:38:34] So Tyrion mischievously messes with their plans.
[00:38:39] Over a game of cyvasse, which is the Game of Thrones version of chess, Tyrion manipulates
[00:38:45] Aegon, and convinces him to change his plan.
[00:38:48] Instead of going east and joining forces with Daenerys, he tells Aegon to go west and attack
[00:38:53] Westeros by himself.
[00:38:55] And since Aegon is young and rash, and JonCon is impatient with his greyscale, the madlads
[00:39:02] actually do it.
[00:39:03] They abandon the plan, and attack Westeros without Daenerys.
[00:39:07] Tyrion doesn’t actually think this a good idea – he only suggests it to mess with
[00:39:13] them, and create chaos.
[00:39:15] But this decision could have huge consequences.
[00:39:18] Like, if Aegon takes the Throne himself, he and Daenerys could become enemies instead
[00:39:25] of allies.
[00:39:26] There are hints that Aegon is not really a Targaryen, he’s actually a Blackfyre.
[00:39:31] And Daenerys is warned of a “mummer’s dragon” or false dragon.
[00:39:36] There are hints of a war between them, a “dance of the dragons” that will cause death and
[00:39:42] destruction across Westeros.
[00:39:45] So Tyrion’s trolling might cause a terrible war.
[00:39:49] And he doesn’t care.
[00:39:51] He laughs when he finds out.
[00:39:53] In his anger and nihilism, Tyrion wants to see the world burn.
[00:40:00] Tyrion is haunted by memories of Tywin, Shae, and Tysha.
[00:40:05] Since Tysha was the one woman who truly loved him, he wants to find her again.
[00:40:11] He imagines them living together in their cottage like they did when they were young
[00:40:15] and happy.
[00:40:16] It’s not a realistic dream, but that distant memory is all he’s got.
[00:40:22] Tywin said that Tysha went “Wherever whores go”.
[00:40:26] So Tyrion repeatedly asks “Where do whores go?”.
[00:40:30] Thinking of Tysha, he visits a brothel.
[00:40:33] And he has sex with a slave prostitute who has dead eyes and a scarred back.
[00:40:40] Tyrion feels wretched, full of shame and guilt and self-hatred.
[00:40:45] He drinks til he pukes, tells the slave to kill him, and then has sex with her again,
[00:40:50] even though she clearly doesn’t want to – he rapes her.
[00:40:55] But in the TV show version of the scene, Tyrion is charming and nice.
[00:41:01] A slave offers him free sex, but Tyrion declines because he’s so sad, in like a noble kind
[00:41:08] of way.
[00:41:09] The show whitewashes Tyrion.
[00:41:12] It takes out the bad stuff he does and makes him into a generic good guy who doesn’t
[00:41:18] change as a character.
[00:41:20] But the books go deep into Tyrion’s emotional devastation, and he does terrible things.
[00:41:27] Tyrion is captured by Jorah, who wants to give him to Daenerys to get back in her favour.
[00:41:33] And they go to Volantis, an ancient slave city in a state of political unrest.
[00:41:39] Cause the rulers of Volantis plan to attack Daenerys because Daenerys is fighting against
[00:41:44] slavery.
[00:41:45] But the slaves of Volantis see Daenerys as a beacon of freedom.
[00:41:50] And the red priests preach that Daenerys is the prophesied saviour Azor Ahai.
[00:41:54] A woman called the widow of the waterfront tells Tyrion that the slaves are waiting for
[00:41:59] Daenerys to come and free them.
[00:42:02] Tyrion agrees go help Daenerys – but not for heroic reasons.
[00:42:07] He says he’ll bring Daenerys his “hate”, and the only reward he asks is to be allowed
[00:42:13] to rape and kill his sister Cersei.
[00:42:17] Tyrion embraces the role of monstrous villain.
[00:42:21] Over in Braavos, Arya’s in a play where the Tyrion character says “As I cannot be
[00:42:27] the hero, let me be the monster, and lesson them in fear in place of love”.
[00:42:34] Then, Tyrion is attacked by a dwarf girl called Penny.
[00:42:39] Penny was one of the performers back at Joffrey’s wedding.
[00:42:42] But when Tyrion escaped Westeros, Cersei put a bounty on Tyrion’s head.
[00:42:47] So a bunch of idiot bounty hunters have killed innocent dwarfs, thinking they might be Tyrion.
[00:42:53] Penny’s brother Oppo was one of those killed, and in her grief and anger, Penny blames Tyrion.
[00:43:01] Tyrion takes pity on Penny, and brings her with them as they sail east.
[00:43:06] Eventually, Tyrion and Penny reconcile, and become friends.
[00:43:11] They’ve got a lot in common.
[00:43:12] They’re both dwarfs who have lost their families and their ways of life.
[00:43:16] They’re both dealing with grief, anger, and suicidal thoughts.
[00:43:21] But unlike Tyrion, Penny moves past her anger.
[00:43:25] She forgives Tyrion for her brother’s death.
[00:43:28] And instead of wallowing in hatred and despair like Tyrion, Penny is optimistic, with hopes
[00:43:36] and dreams for the future.
[00:43:38] Penny tells Tyrion to stop his self-destructive behaviour.
[00:43:43] Like, Tyrion makes fun of Jorah until Jorah hits Tyrion.
[00:43:48] And Penny tells him he’s gotta stop provoking people or he’ll get himself killed.
[00:43:52] It used to be that Tyrion could say what he liked, cause he was a rich and powerful nobleman.
[00:43:57] But now as an exile, he’s no one, so when he talks shit he gets hit.
[00:44:04] Tyrion has always felt sorry for himself, but he was very lucky to be born into a rich
[00:44:09] noble family.
[00:44:10] He’s been protected by his privilege all his life.
[00:44:14] But Penny is a common person as well as dwarf, and she’s learned the hard way how to survive.
[00:44:21] Tyrion hates being laughed at, but Penny says making people laugh can be a good thing.
[00:44:27] In fact, if Tyrion had ridden her pig at Joffrey’s wedding like Joffrey asked, instead of insulting
[00:44:33] Joffrey, Tyrion might never have been condemned, and Penny’s brother might not have died.
[00:44:39] No one should have to put up with humiliation.
[00:44:41] But many of Tyrion’s problems are caused by his pride.
[00:44:46] When morale on their ship gets dangerously low, Penny convinces Tyrion to perform a joust
[00:44:51] with her, riding her pig against her dog.
[00:44:54] So Penny challenges Tyrion’s pride, his privilege, his self-destructive behaviour.
[00:45:01] She shows him that he’s not the only dwarf in the world who’s suffered.
[00:45:05] And that it’s possible to forgive and hope.
[00:45:10] Penny has a crush on Tyrion, and they kiss a couple of times.
[00:45:14] But Tyrion isn’t interested in her like that.
[00:45:17] The only woman he loves is his idealised memory of Tysha.
[00:45:21] So Tyrion has a complicated relationship with Penny.
[00:45:25] He’s protective of her, and kind, sometimes, but he rejects her love, and he mostly rejects
[00:45:32] her positive, hopeful attitude.
[00:45:34] Tyrion stays angry and proud and cynical.
[00:45:38] And he moves closer to power.
[00:45:41] A red priest called Moqorro has a vision of Tyrion with dragons – “Dragons old and
[00:45:47] young, true and false, bright and dark” – with Tyrion snarling in their midst, a
[00:45:53] small man with a big shadow.
[00:45:56] The old dragons could be Aemon or Bloodraven.
[00:45:59] The young and true dragons could be Daenerys and Jon Snow who is probably secretly a Targaryen.
[00:46:05] And the false, dark dragon could be Aegon – cause he might actually be a Blackfyre
[00:46:10] not a Targaryen.
[00:46:12] And through these dragons, Tyrion will have a big impact on the story.
[00:46:16] In Book 1, Tyrion cast a shadow as “tall as a king”.
[00:46:20] Aemon said Tyrion “is a giant come among us, here at the end of the world”.
[00:46:26] So there’s lots of foreshadowing that Tyrion will play a big role in the endgame of the
[00:46:32] story.
[00:46:33] Their ship is damaged in a storm, Moqorro floats off to Victarion, and Tyrion Penny
[00:46:38] and Jorah are captured by slavers outside Meereen – the city is under siege by the
[00:46:44] slavers of Yunkai while Daenerys tries to negotiate peace.
[00:46:48] Tyrion, Penny and Jorah are bought as slaves by a Yunkishman called Yezzan zo Qaggaz, or
[00:46:54] the Yellow Whale.
[00:46:55] Yezzan is enormously rich and enormously fat, and he keeps a grotesquery of slaves with
[00:47:02] unusual bodies, watched over by his cruel overseer, Nurse.
[00:47:07] Tyrion has gone from a proud powerful ruler in Westeros to a powerless humiliated slave.
[00:47:14] Inside Meereen, Daenerys tries to make peace with the slavers by marrying Hizdahr, and
[00:47:19] opening the fighting pits.
[00:47:21] Tyrion and Penny are made to perform for the crowds – so the first time Tyrion and Daenerys
[00:47:26] see each other, Tyrion is riding a pig.
[00:47:29] Though she doesn’t know he’s Tyrion, and they still haven’t met.
[00:47:33] Cause Drogon crashes the party, Daenerys flies off, and Yunkai prepares to attack Meereen.
[00:47:40] A disease called the bloody flux breaks out, and Yezzan gets sick.
[00:47:44] Yezzan was dying already from an exotic disease he got in Sothoryos.
[00:47:48] So pretty soon he’s squirting his guts out, and Tyrion takes the opportunity to escape.
[00:47:54] On the way out, Tyrion kills Nurse with some poison mushrooms – and says “A Lannister
[00:47:59] always pays his debts”.
[00:48:01] So after all the crazy stuff that happens in this book, Tyrion is still a Lannister.
[00:48:07] He’s still proud, spiteful, and murderous, like his father.
[00:48:12] The main way that Tyrion has changed since the start of Book 5 is that he’s less depressed
[00:48:17] now, he doesn’t want to die any more.
[00:48:19] He originally considered using these poisoned mushrooms to kill himself in Pentos, but now
[00:48:25] he chooses to live, and get revenge.
[00:48:28] Tyrion goes to a mercenary captain called Brown Ben Plumm, commander of the Second Sons.
[00:48:34] Tyrion convinces him to let him and Penny and Jorah join his company to escape slavery.
[00:48:41] And in return, Tyrion promises Ben money and a lordship when Tyrion gets power back in
[00:48:46] Westeros.
[00:48:47] So Tyrion Penny and Jorah escape slavery, but now they’re stuck in the middle of a
[00:48:52] battle between the slavers and Daenerys’ forces.
[00:48:55] Daenerys herself is still missing in the Dothraki Sea.
[00:48:58] So Barristan commands her army, alongside Grey Worm and the Unsullied, some sellswords,
[00:49:04] and freed slaves.
[00:49:05] Ben Plumm and the Second Sons are on the side of the slavers, but Tyrion hopes to convince
[00:49:10] them to join Daenerys instead.
[00:49:13] So Tyrion’s back in the game of thrones, playing politics, being a Lannister again.
[00:49:18] And he is as ruthless as ever – he compares himself to Tywin, and thinks about poisoning
[00:49:25] wells.
[00:49:26] Tyrion wants to join Daenerys but not because he.. believes in her or anything.
[00:49:30] He just thinks that she’s his best hope of bringing fire and sword to Westeros.
[00:49:36] So in Book 5, Tyrion loses everything, and falls deep into despair and hate.
[00:49:42] But now, he’s returning to the game of thrones.
[00:49:46] When he gets power, will he use it for violence and vengeance like Tywin would?
[00:49:51] Or will he find forgiveness and hope like Penny?
[00:49:55] Author George Martin has released sample chapters of the upcoming next book, The Winds
[00:50:00] of Winter.
[00:50:00] In the opening chapters, Tyrion convinces Ben Plumm and his men to switch sides and
[00:50:05] join Daenerys.
[00:50:06] Another sellsword company called the Windblown also join Daenerys.
[00:50:10] Victarion Greyjoy and Moqorro arrive with the ironborn and attack the slavers.
[00:50:14] The dragons Rhaegal and Viserion are loose.
[00:50:17] And Ser Barristan rides into battle.
[00:50:21] So it looks like Daenerys’ forces will defeat the slavers, leaving a very strange bunch
[00:50:27] of characters in charge of Meereen.
[00:50:30] Barristan is Daenerys’ closest ally, so Tyrion will want to win his trust – though
[00:50:35] Tyrion suspects that Barristan will hate him for being a villainous kinslayer.
[00:50:40] Victarion wants to marry Daenerys and steal her dragons, which probably won’t end well
[00:50:46] for him.
[00:50:46] But if he survives the battle, we could get some fun dialogue with Tyrion making fun of
[00:50:51] Victarion “dumb as a stump” Greyjoy.
[00:50:54] Moqorro could teach Tyrion more about magic and prophecy.
[00:50:58] Marwyn the Mage should arrive sometime, and he’s also into magic and books.
[00:51:02] Ben Plumm and the Tattered Prince will want battle and plunder, Jorah wants to get out
[00:51:08] of the friendzone with Daenerys, though he’s picked up an unfortunate face tattoo recently.
[00:51:13] Daario is still around, and he wants Daenerys.
[00:51:16] And Strong Belwas wants.. liver and onions.
[00:51:19] It’s a colourful collection of characters, and a great opportunity for Tyrion to play
[00:51:24] politics, crack jokes, rule Meereen, and set himself up as an advisor to Daenerys when
[00:51:30] she returns.
[00:51:31] Daenerys won’t trust Tyrion right away.
[00:51:34] Cause Tyrion is a Lannister, condemned as treacherous kingslayer.
[00:51:39] But Tyrion is very good at convincing people to make alliances.
[00:51:43] And Tyrion has lots of useful information that Daenerys needs.
[00:51:48] Daenerys has never been to mainland Westeros.
[00:51:50] She doesn’t know her enemies.
[00:51:53] But Tyrion intimately knows Cersei, Jaime, King Tommen, and other lords.
[00:51:58] Tyrion knows the defences of King’s Landing and Casterly Rock.
[00:52:02] And Tyrion is the only person in Meereen who knows about Aegon and JonCon.
[00:52:08] Tyrion can tell her that Aegon is on his way to take her Throne, which could convince Daenerys
[00:52:13] to get to Westeros ASAP.
[00:52:16] Tyrion could manipulate Daenerys and tell her that that Aegon is her enemy, to encourage
[00:52:22] conflict and chaos.
[00:52:24] So, like in the show, Tyrion will probably become Daenerys’ advisor or Hand of the
[00:52:28] Queen.
[00:52:29] But his advice to Daenerys may be very different to the show.
[00:52:33] In the show, Tyrion tells Daenerys to be merciful to the slavers, so instead of killing them
[00:52:38] all, they just kill some and give the rest a stern talking to.
[00:52:43] But book Tyrion, in his anger and hate, won’t want mercy for the people who just enslaved
[00:52:49] him – he’ll want revenge.
[00:52:51] Book Daenerys also wants violence.
[00:52:54] All through Book 5, she tries to rule Meereen peacefully – making compromises, marrying
[00:52:59] Hizdahr, chaining her dragons.
[00:53:02] But peace fails, so she flies off on her dragon, and she has visions reminding her that she
[00:53:07] is “the blood of the dragon”, that Meereen is not her home, that the Targaryen words
[00:53:13] are “Fire and Blood”.
[00:53:15] Daenerys is done with peace, she’s set to burn her enemies.
[00:53:20] And Daenerys once said that if Yunkai attacks her, she will raze their city to the ground.
[00:53:26] So Daenerys and Tyrion’s first act together won’t be this half-assed compromise.
[00:53:31] It might be to destroy Yunkai.
[00:53:34] George Martin said Daenerys has “embraced her heritage as a Targaryen”, and she and
[00:53:40] Tyrion are “coming home”.
[00:53:42] But it’s a long way from Meereen to Westeros.
[00:53:46] And they have unfinished business in Essos.
[00:53:48] The red priests and the widow of the waterfront want Daenerys to free the slaves of Volantis.
[00:53:54] Which might get violent – a priest prophesies that Volantis will burn.
[00:53:59] And conveniently, the ruling slavers of Volantis live within the Black Walls in the heart of
[00:54:04] the city – making them a convenient target for Daenerys to roast them all with dragonfire.
[00:54:10] Moqorro may convince Daenerys of her destiny to be “a sword of fire that will cleanse
[00:54:16] the world”, pushing her further towards violence.
[00:54:20] Daenerys also has business in Pentos.
[00:54:23] Cause the captain of the Windblown, the Tattered Prince, joins Daenerys on the condition that
[00:54:28] he gets to take over Pentos.
[00:54:30] Daenerys hasn’t agreed to this yet – at first she says she won’t give Pentos to
[00:54:35] Tatters, because Illyrio lives in Pentos, and Illyrio is her trusted ally.
[00:54:40] But Tyrion can tell Daenerys the truth – that Illyrio has been lying and manipulating her
[00:54:46] all along.
[00:54:47] Illyrio really supports Aegon, and while Illyrio was selling Daenerys to the Dothraki, he was
[00:54:52] raising Aegon in secrecy and safety.
[00:54:56] Tyrion could convince Daenerys to burn Illyrio for his betrayal, and to give Pentos to the
[00:55:02] Tattered Prince.
[00:55:03] We don’t know what Tatters’ plans are for Pentos, but it’s probably something
[00:55:08] bad.
[00:55:09] Tatters has history with Pentos, and he’s a cruel and brutal man.
[00:55:14] One time, Tatters cut off a guy’s foot, then forced him to eat it, and then made him
[00:55:19] his cook, that’s the sort of guy Tatters is.
[00:55:22] And Daenerys and Tyrion might give him the city of Pentos.
[00:55:27] So there are strong hints in the books that Daenerys’ journey across Essos will be violent
[00:55:33] and destructive, bringing fire and blood across the continent.
[00:55:37] Will Tyrion encourage this violence?
[00:55:40] Or will he tell Daenerys to be more peaceful?
[00:55:43] Tyrion’s peaceful, compassionate side is represented by his relationship with Penny.
[00:55:48] And in his latest chapters, he rejects her optimism pretty harshly – he slaps her,
[00:55:54] tells her to stop dreaming, and to face harsh reality.
[00:55:58] There are even hints that Tyrion might hurt Penny.
[00:56:01] Tyrion dreams of shooting Penny with a crossbow.
[00:56:04] And there’s a weird dark moment when Penny reminds Tyrion of Shae, and he’s overwhelmed
[00:56:10] with rage, and Tyrion thinks about killing Penny.
[00:56:14] If Tyrion kills Penny, or just rejects or loses her somehow, that could be the breaking
[00:56:21] point that leads Tyrion to fully embrace Daenerys’ bloody conquest.
[00:56:27] And Tyrion might develop a connection with Daenerys’ dragons.
[00:56:32] Tyrion has always been fascinated with dragons, so he’s read lots of books about them.
[00:56:37] This knowledge is considered so valuable that JonCon makes him write down everything he
[00:56:41] knows about dragons in case it’s useful.
[00:56:44] So this knowledge is another way Tyrion can help Daenerys.
[00:56:47] Cause Daenerys doesn’t actually know much
[00:56:50] about dragons, she has a lot of trouble controlling
[00:56:53] hers in the books.
[00:56:54] They keep disobeying her, and eating children.
[00:56:57] They didn’t come with a manual.
[00:56:58] [She can’t Google it].
[00:56:58] So Tyrion might help Daenerys control her dragons, maybe even breed them, or design
[00:57:04] dragon armour, or a dragon-riding saddle, like the saddle he designed for Bran.
[00:57:09] And maybe Tyrion will ride a dragon himself.
[00:57:14] He does dream of riding a dragon and burning his enemies.
[00:57:17] And author George Martin has hinted that Tyrion will fly.
[00:57:22] Daenerys believes that her three dragons need three riders.
[00:57:27] Jon Snow will probably ride one, like he does in the TV show.
[00:57:30] He rides the green dragon, Rhaegal, who is named after his [probable] father Rhaegar.
[00:57:35] Daenerys rides the black dragon, Drogon.
[00:57:38] So Tyrion could ride Viserion – Viserion is coloured white and gold, and his blood
[00:57:44] is “gold and red” which fits Tyrion’s Lannister colours.
[00:57:49] At the end of his latest preview chapter, Tyrion dramatically picks up a white dragon
[00:57:54] cyvasse piece, which hints at a connection between him and the white dragon Viserion.
[00:58:00] Usually, dragons are only ridden by Targaryens, people with the Valyrian “blood of the dragon”.
[00:58:07] And Tyrion isn’t a Targaryen.
[00:58:09] Or is he?
[00:58:11] There is a theory that Tyrion is not the son of Tywin Lannister, he’s actually the son
[00:58:16] of the Mad King, Aerys Targaryen.
[00:58:19] Cause for years, Aerys was sexually interested in Tyrion’s mother, Joanna Lannister.
[00:58:25] It was rumoured that he took her virginity, and that she was his mistress for a while.
[00:58:30] At Joanna’s wedding to Tywin, Aerys joked that he wanted to have sex with her, and he
[00:58:35] took “liberties” at the bedding.
[00:58:38] Aerys’ wife complained that Aerys was turning her ladies into his “whores”, so Joanna
[00:58:43] went back to Casterly Rock for a while.
[00:58:46] But then, the year before Tyrion was born, Aerys and Joanna were both at a tournament
[00:58:52] in King’s Landing.
[00:58:53] Aerys made comments about Joanna’s breasts, and Tywin got so angry that he tried to resign
[00:58:59] as Hand.
[00:59:00] The next year, Tyrion was born.
[00:59:03] So maybe, at this tournament, Aerys had sex with Joanna and fathered Tyrion.
[00:59:09] Being a Targaryen could explain Tyrion’s pale blond hair, which looks more like the
[00:59:14] Targaryen silvery blond than the Lannister golden blond.
[00:59:18] Tyrion’s green eye could be from his Lannister mother, and his black eye could actually be
[00:59:23] a very dark Targaryen purple.
[00:59:26] Targaryen blood could explain why Tyrion doesn’t catch greyscale or the bloody flux – because
[00:59:31] Targaryens tend not to get sick.
[00:59:33] It could explain Tyrion’s dreams of dragons, which are common in Targaryens.
[00:59:38] And Targaryen blood could let Tyrion ride a dragon.
[00:59:42] In Book 5, Daenerys’ dragons like Ben Plumm.
[00:59:46] And Tyrion explains that this is because Ben has some Targaryen blood in his family tree.
[00:59:51] Maybe the reason this is mentioned in the book is so that when Tyrion meets Daenerys’
[00:59:55] dragons, they’ll like him too, hinting that Tyrion also has Targaryen blood.
[01:00:01] And then Barristan, who was Aerys’ guard for years, could reveal that Aerys is Tyrion’s
[01:00:07] father.
[01:00:08] It all fits – the white dragon, the timeline, his appearance, his dreams – Tyrion could
[01:00:14] be a Targaryen.
[01:00:16] But does the story really need another secret Targaryen?
[01:00:20] We’ve already got Jon Snow probably being a secret Targaryen, and Young Griff being
[01:00:25] a secret Targaryen or a Blackfyre.
[01:00:28] Do we really need all three main characters
[01:00:30] to be Targaryens, whose mothers died in childbirth,
[01:00:34] who ride dragons?
[01:00:35] And if Tyrion is Aerys’s son, what does that mean for his relationship with Tywin?
[01:00:40] The whole point of their relationship is that even though Tywin hates Tyrion, Tyrion is
[01:00:45] just like Tywin, Tyrion is Tywin “writ small”.
[01:00:49] Isn’t that ruined if Tyrion is actually Aerys’ son?
[01:00:53] You could argue that even if Aerys is Tyrion’s biological father, Tywin is the father who
[01:00:58] raised Tyrion, and his shitty parenting made Tyrion who he is.
[01:01:03] It’s like how even if Rhaegar is Jon Snow’s biological father, Ned Stark is the father
[01:01:08] who raised Jon, and made him the person who he is.
[01:01:12] And it kind of makes sense if Tywin always suspected that Tyrion was Aerys’ son.
[01:01:17] Like, he does say that Tyrion is not his son, but that he just cannot prove that Tyrion
[01:01:23] isn’t his.
[01:01:24] Cause there is no proof whether Tyrion is a Targaryen.
[01:01:28] Only hints.
[01:01:29] And maybe that ambiguity is the point.
[01:01:33] Maybe we’ll never know for sure.
[01:01:35] Like, maybe Tyrion will start to develop a connection with Viserion, but then Viserion
[01:01:40] will be killed or taken by Euron before Tyrion can fully explore his Targaryen side.
[01:01:45] So maybe he’ll always question his identity – is he a Lannister or a Targaryen?
[01:01:51] Tywin wondered the same thing – he was never quite sure if Tyrion was his son, he didn’t
[01:01:57] want to believe Tyrion was his.
[01:02:00] Because Tyrion was a reflection of everything Tywin hated about himself.
[01:02:06] It’s because Tyrion is so much like Tywin that Tywin denied Tyrion was his, and preferred
[01:02:11] to believe he was Aerys’ instead.
[01:02:14] But Tyrion, unlike Tywin, could face the truth – that it doesn’t matter whether Aerys
[01:02:20] is his biological father.
[01:02:22] Tyrion was raised as a Lannister, his personality and values were shaped by Tywin, so for better
[01:02:28] or worse, no matter what’s in his blood, “Tyrion is Tywin’s son”.
[01:02:33] And besides, George Martin has hinted that the third dragonrider doesn’t necessarily
[01:02:38] need to be a Targaryen, so maybe Tyrion could ride a dragon either way.
[01:02:43] The other thing Tyrion needs to resolve are his feelings about Tysha – his pain and
[01:02:48] his longing for his lost love.
[01:02:50] Will he ever find “where whores go”?
[01:02:54] George Martin has said that we will find out where whores go.
[01:02:57] So… where?
[01:02:59] In Braavos, Arya meets a sex worker called the Sailor’s Wife.
[01:03:03] Before she has sex with men, she always marries them in a fun temporary ceremony with a drunken
[01:03:09] priest – like how Tysha married Tyrion in a fun ceremony with a drunken priest.
[01:03:15] The Sailor’s Wife likes singing, like how Tysha used to sing for Tyrion.
[01:03:20] And she’s a “whore”, just like Tysha was supposedly a “whore”.
[01:03:25] The Sailor’s Wife is a fun, and kind person, though there’s something sad about her too.
[01:03:31] She often prays for her first husband, her true love, to come back to her.
[01:03:36] Maybe that husband was Tyrion, and the Sailor’s Wife is Tysha.
[01:03:41] She could’ve fled from Westeros, and set herself up in Braavos.
[01:03:45] And thing is, the Sailor’s Wife has a blonde daughter called Lanna.
[01:03:50] Lanna is fourteen years old, and Tysha and Tyrion were married either fourteen or fifteen
[01:03:56] years ago.
[01:03:57] So the timeline fits – Lanna could be Tyrion Lannister’s daughter with Tysha.
[01:04:04] There are problems with this theory – like, the Sailor’s Wife says her husband was..
[01:04:08] a sailor.
[01:04:09] And Tyrion’s not a sailor – so maybe her husband was actually Tyrion’s uncle Gerion.
[01:04:14] But the sailor thing could just be a lie she tells to protect herself.
[01:04:18] The other problem is that a fortune-teller says that the Sailor’s Wife’s husband
[01:04:22] is dead, and if he comes back to her, it will be as a corpse.
[01:04:27] Tyrion isn’t literally dead.
[01:04:29] But he does think of himself as being metaphorically
[01:04:32] dead, having died in King’s Landing and
[01:04:35] become a ghost.
[01:04:37] So if The Sailor’s Wife is Tysha, maybe he will come back to her, in Braavos.
[01:04:43] Daenerys and Tyrion could stop there on the way west – maybe Daenerys could borrow money
[01:04:48] from the Iron Bank, or fight the Faceless Men or something.
[01:04:51] But Tyrion and Tysha’s reunion may not be a happy one.
[01:04:55] Because Tyrion and Tysha aren’t the innocent teenagers they remember each other as.
[01:05:00] Tyrion has become a “corpse” – a hateful murderous version of the boy he used to be,
[01:05:07] and Tysha has.. ironically become a “whore”, which is what Tyrion always feared she was.
[01:05:13] If a reunion with Tysha goes badly, and they don’t meet each others’ impossible idealised
[01:05:19] standards, that could push Tyrion into an even darker more destructive place – right
[01:05:26] as he arrives back at Westeros.
[01:05:29] So in the next book, Daenerys will carve a bloody path across Essos, with Tyrion by her
[01:05:35] side.
[01:05:36] Tyrion might ride a dragon, he might reunite with Tysha, and he might lose or kill Penny.
[01:05:44] Winds has the potential to be Tyrion’s darkest book, where he fully embraces fire and blood.
[01:05:52] At the end of the TV show, Daenerys burns King’s Landing, killing thousands
[01:05:57] of innocent people out of anger and frustration.
[01:06:01] And a lot of people complained that this terrible dark turn happened too suddenly.
[01:06:06] There wasn’t enough buildup and exploration of why Daenerys would do something so evil.
[01:06:12] In the books, her journey across Essos could be that gradual buildup of destruction.
[01:06:18] Her allies and advisors in the books will be violent fiery people like Tatters and Ben
[01:06:24] and Moqorro, the ironborn and Dothraki.. and Tyrion, the devil on her shoulder, urging
[01:06:30] her to burn Westeros for his revenge.
[01:06:34] The situation in King’s Landing will be different.
[01:06:36] It might be Aegon, not Cersei, who has the Throne, possibly in alliance with Dorne, the
[01:06:42] Reach and the Faith.
[01:06:43] And Aegon may be popular with the common people – there’s a vision of the mummer’s dragon
[01:06:48] “amidst a cheering crowd”.
[01:06:50] If the common people support Aegon over Daenerys, Daenerys may see the people as her enemies.
[01:06:57] Jon Connington could be there, and interestingly, JonCon has a traumatic backstory involving
[01:07:03] bells, which might be the reason for the bells that ring in the show before Daenerys burns
[01:07:07] the city.
[01:07:08] There also could be wildfire in the mix.
[01:07:11] Cersei and Jaime might be there, perhaps as prisoners of Aegon.
[01:07:15] And the spark behind the fire could be Tyrion.
[01:07:18] Cause King’s Landing is where Tyrion was betrayed by Tywin, Cersei, Jaime, and Shae.
[01:07:24] It’s the city he fought to save before its people rejected and condemned him.
[01:07:30] He said he wished he had enough poison to kill them all, and ever since he’s wanted
[01:07:36] revenge, to pay his debts.
[01:07:39] During Robert’s Rebellion, Tywin brutally sacked King’s Landing, killing men women
[01:07:45] and children.
[01:07:46] And part of the reason why he did this so savagely was probably to get revenge on King
[01:07:51] Aerys and everyone else who mocked and disrespected
[01:07:54] him when he was Hand of the King.
[01:07:56] Now Tyrion is set to repeat history, and to attack that same city because of how he was
[01:08:02] treated when he was Hand of the King.
[01:08:04] Tyrion will repeat the sins of his father.
[01:08:08] In the show, Tyrion tells Daenerys not to burn King’s Landing, but in the books, he
[01:08:12] could encourage or manipulate her into doing it, by turning her against Aegon and the common
[01:08:18] people, or by not telling her about the dangerous wildfire, or even by starting the fire on
[01:08:25] a dragon of his own.
[01:08:26] However it happens, the burning King’s Landing would be the ultimate expression of Tyrion’s
[01:08:32] hate and pain, especially if it kills Jaime and Cersei.
[01:08:37] But revenge won’t make Tyrion happy in the end.
[01:08:41] In Book 5, he has a dream where he fights a battle with dragons overhead.
[01:08:46] He kills Tywin, and he kills Jaime, but then Tyrion realises he’s crying.
[01:08:52] As Ellaria says, revenge doesn’t fix anything.
[01:08:55] It doesn’t bring back what you’ve lost.
[01:08:57] A skull can’t make you happy.
[01:09:00] In the show, Tyrion walks through the ashes of King’s Landing, and cries over the bodies
[01:09:05] of Jaime and Cersei.
[01:09:07] The tragedy in the show is that Tyrion failed to protect his family.
[01:09:11] But in the books, the tragedy could be that he killed his family, and only realised it
[01:09:17] was a mistake when it was too late.
[01:09:20] In the show, Bran makes Tyrion Hand of the King, and says he’ll work to fix his “terrible
[01:09:25] mistakes”.
[01:09:26] But Tyrion’s terrible mistake in the TV show was believing in Daenerys, who turned
[01:09:32] evil despite his good intentions.
[01:09:35] It could be so much more tragic in the books if Tyrion’s “mistake” is encouraging
[01:09:40] Daenerys’ violence, choosing hate and revenge.
[01:09:45] So will Tyrion end the series as a villain, like Tywin?
[01:09:50] Or could he redeem himself?
[01:09:52] In the show, the white walkers are defeated, then King’s Landing burns.
[01:09:56] But in the books, it might be the other way around – because Jon killing Daenerys makes
[01:10:01] more sense in the context of the white walkers, because of the Azor Ahai story – so maybe
[01:10:05] after Tyrion and Daenerys burn King’s Landing, Tyrion will help defeat the white walkers.
[01:10:11] He could finally realise that saving the world is more important than politics and revenge.
[01:10:17] The Night’s Watch were right, this is what he should have been doing all along.
[01:10:21] When Tyrion stood on the Wall in Book 1, he felt something, he sensed that the white walkers
[01:10:27] were the true enemy.
[01:10:29] He could help fight them by riding a dragon maybe, or just help politically, by building
[01:10:34] alliances with the Starks.
[01:10:36] Tyrion and Jon still think of each other as friends, and Tyrion has relationships with
[01:10:41] Bran and his wife Sansa.
[01:10:43] So maybe Tyrion will team up with the Starks and redeem himself by saving the world from
[01:10:48] the white walkers.
[01:10:50] Or maybe that’s too much of a happy ending.
[01:10:53] Maybe Tyrion deserves punishment.
[01:10:57] Characters talk about cutting out Tyrion’s tongue eight times in the books.
[01:11:02] Because Tyrion constantly annoys people with his jokes and insults, and his words cause
[01:11:08] so much trouble.
[01:11:09] Removing someone’s tongue is a common punishment in Westeros.
[01:11:13] Euron Greyjoy often cuts out peoples’ tongues, and he’s becoming a major bad guy in the
[01:11:18] books.
[01:11:18] He might take Tyrion’s dragon Viserion, before taking Tyrion’s tongue.
[01:11:24] Cersei is another possibility – she hates Tyrion, and she’s been talking a lot about
[01:11:29] cutting out tongues lately.
[01:11:31] Tyrion losing his tongue would fit a pattern with his siblings – cause each of the Lannisters
[01:11:36] lose the part of themselves that give them power and pride.
[01:11:40] Jaime loses his hand that made him a great warrior.
[01:11:43] Cersei loses her image as a proud beautiful queen in her walk of shame.
[01:11:48] And Tyrion’s power and pride is in his sharp witty tongue, so if he loses his tongue, all
[01:11:54] three Lannisters will have lost their most important part.
[01:11:58] When Jaime loses his hand, and Bran breaks his back, and Arya loses her sight, these
[01:12:03] are challenges that force the characters to grow and redefine themselves.
[01:12:08] But Tyrion has kind of already had his downfall – he’s already lost everything.
[01:12:13] So losing his tongue might not be about growing his character.
[01:12:17] It could be more of a brutal final tragedy at the end of his story, as a punishment for
[01:12:23] all his crimes.
[01:12:25] If Tyrion’s words and lies convince Daenerys to burn King’s Landing, maybe King Bran
[01:12:31] will take Tyrion’s tongue so his words can’t do evil again.
[01:12:36] He could live out his days as a quiet lion at Casterly Rock, or as a mute maester at
[01:12:41] the Citadel, or with the Night’s Watch.
[01:12:45] Tyrion remembers that Jeor Mormont said they need men like Tyrion in the Watch.
[01:12:50] Tyrion remembers that the Watch welcomes outcasts and misfits no matter their past crimes – which
[01:12:55] is perfect for a criminal outcast like Tyrion.
[01:12:56] Maybe with the brotherhood of the Watch, Tyrion will finally find the family and acceptance
[01:13:01] he’s always wanted.
[01:13:03] Sam says that someone really needs to sort through the books in the Castle Black library,
[01:13:07] which’ll take years of work.
[01:13:09] But Sam will be busy being Grand Maester.
[01:13:12] So maybe Tyrion could sort out the Night’s Watch’s books.
[01:13:15] Tyrion’s first chapter begins with him reading a book – that was always his comfort and
[01:13:21] his escape.
[01:13:22] So maybe the series will end with Tyrion reading a book – quietly.
[01:13:28] So is Tyrion Lannister a villain?
[01:13:31] From the beginning, Tyrion felt unloved and rejected.
[01:13:35] So he used political power to try to earn some respect.
[01:13:39] But then he was betrayed and condemned by the people closest to him.
[01:13:43] So Tyrion falls deep into despair and hate, and dreams of revenge.
[01:13:49] In the next book, he may embrace fire and blood.
[01:13:52] He might spark the burning of King’s Landing.
[01:13:55] But he might also help save the world from the white walkers.
[01:13:59] Tyrion is villainous – he’s a hateful, ruthless murderer, like his father.
[01:14:05] But he is also heroic – he is sometimes kind, protective and brave.
[01:14:11] George Martin did once call Tyrion a villain, but he more often calls Tyrion morally grey.
[01:14:18] Martin writes about the human heart in conflict with itself.
[01:14:21] And no one’s heart is more conflicted than Tyrion’s.
[01:14:26] There’s love and hate, good and evil inside him.
[01:14:30] And to be human is to look for the light.

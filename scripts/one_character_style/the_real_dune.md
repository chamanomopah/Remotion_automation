[00:00:01] Dune is a movie with giant sandworms,
[00:00:04] mysterious witches, and Timothee Chalamet tripping balls in the desert.
[00:00:08] There’s spaceships and spice and Zendaya with blue eyes, and almost none of it is explained. Even
[00:00:15] Dune’s characters have to watch YouTube videos to understand the story. So what’s going on in Dune?
[00:00:21] The movie is based on a book that was written by Frank Herbert in the 60s. There have been
[00:00:26] many attempts to adapt this book to movies and TV and most of them.. aren’t very good.
[00:00:36] Dune has been called “unfilmable” because the book is so.. weird and complicated. The writing is full
[00:00:42] of internal monologue and thoughts instead of action and dialogue. The plot is layered with
[00:00:48] heaps of secret plans and hidden motivations. Its worldbuilding is richly detailed with hundreds of
[00:00:55] words for its languages, cultures and religions. Dune explores big ideas about consciousness,
[00:01:02] politics, and philosophy. And the Dune sequel books get increasingly strange and cerebral.
[00:01:09] The new movie is a.. pretty close adaptation of the first half of the first book. But it still
[00:01:14] leaves out a lot of important plotlines and details. So how does the book compare to the
[00:01:20] movie – what’s the real story of Dune? This video has spoilers for the 2021 Dune movie,
[00:01:26] and for the first half of the first book. It has no big spoilers for the next Dune movie or for
[00:01:32] the sequel books, but it does mention some small lore details and quotes from the sequel books.
[00:01:38] So Dune is set thousands of years in the future. Humans live on many planets across the universe.
[00:01:45] And they’re ruled by the Emperor, Shaddam the Fourth – we see the Emperor’s Herald in the movie,
[00:01:50] but we don’t see Shaddam himself. Beneath the Emperor are the Great Houses, like House
[00:01:56] Atreides and House Harkonnen – powerful political dynasties who rule planets with armies and wealth.
[00:02:03] The Houses meet in a congress called the Landsraad, which balances against the power
[00:02:08] of the Emperor. The other big political power is the Spacing Guild – cause the Guild controls all
[00:02:14] interstellar spaceflight. Guild navigators use a drug called spice that lets them see into the
[00:02:20] future – which is the only way to guide spaceships safely across the stars. In the movie, these big
[00:02:27] Guild spaceships, called Heighliners, look like tunnels that you can pass through to instantly
[00:02:32] reach a distant planet – you can see another world through this ship, it’s like a wormhole. The later
[00:02:40] Dune books describe this as folding space. The Guild is “secretive” and mysterious – it’s
[00:02:46] hinted that Guild navigators have “mutated” and “don’t look … human anymore”. So everyone kinda
[00:02:53] hates the Guild for being creepy extortionate space weirdos, but everyone needs them to travel.
[00:02:59] So for thousands of years, the universe has been ruled by this balance of the Emperor,
[00:03:04] Houses and Guild. They’re bound together by a Great Convention, which has rules
[00:03:09] banning the use of nuclear weapons. But a cheeky bit of assassination and warfare is allowed within
[00:03:15] limits. Politics in Dune is a deadly game. Every noble family watches their back for assassins,
[00:03:23] and tests their food for poison. The Houses rule their planets under a strict
[00:03:28] feudal class system – slavery, oppression, and exploitation are common – this is an unfair,
[00:03:34] unequal universe. The Houses have shares in the CHOAM Company, which controls trade in
[00:03:40] the universe. It’s kinda like the Dutch East India Company, or Amazon in space. CHOAM means
[00:03:47] money, and all the Houses fight for a slice. In this struggle, a tiny shift in interest rates
[00:03:53] can “change the ownership of an entire planet”. Science and technology is limited in Dune. Like,
[00:04:01] there are giant spaceships and laser guns, but there are strictly no computers, or robots, or AI.
[00:04:08] Cause thousands of years in the past, people did rely on “thinking machines”,
[00:04:12] but then some people used those machines to take over the world and enslave people, and it sucked.
[00:04:18] So then there was a religious crusade called the Butlerian Jihad that destroyed all the computers
[00:04:24] and banned them forever. In the Orange Catholic Bible it is written “Thou shalt not make a machine
[00:04:31] in the likeness of a man’s mind”. The idea is that thinking and making our own decisions is
[00:04:38] what makes us human. Letting machines think for us makes us less free, less conscious – so that’s why
[00:04:46] the machines were destroyed. Ever since, humans have had to learn to think for themselves. They
[00:04:51] founded schools to train the human mind and body to its full potential. So now there are people
[00:04:58] called Mentats – “Human computers” who can think super logically. They process data, calculate
[00:05:05] probabilities, and perceive peoples’ motives. The Mentat Thufir Hawat works as a strategic advisor
[00:05:12] to House Atreides. In the books, Mentats take a drug called sapho to make themselves smarter, and
[00:05:18] the drug stains their lips red. In the new movie, Mentats just have tattoos on their lips instead.
[00:05:25] Like the Mentats, the Navigators of the Spacing Guild have trained their brains to
[00:05:30] calculate the mathematics of spaceflight. And the other important school is the
[00:05:35] Bene Gesserit, an ancient mystical order of women with highly trained minds and bodies.
[00:05:41] Their practice is influenced by Zen Buddhism, with meditation and contemplation to achieve
[00:05:47] inner balance. Bene Gesserit can precisely control all their muscles and nerves, even their body’s
[00:05:53] biochemistry and their reproductive systems. They have powerful memories and perception,
[00:05:59] they can read peoples’ feelings through their words and body language. They can control people
[00:06:04] with their Voice, they can fight in the weirding way, they’re basically.. ninja nuns. The Bene
[00:06:12] Gesserit are named after the Jesuits, a real-world Catholic order. Like the Jesuits, the Bene
[00:06:18] Gesserit do missionary work in distant places. And they have political ambitions. The Bene Gesserit
[00:06:25] work with the Emperor and Houses, and they say they live to serve. But the Bene Gesserit have
[00:06:32] their own plans – for centuries, these witches have manipulated the universe from the shadows.
[00:06:39] So Dune is about a galactic empire with medieval politics. It’s a sci fi future
[00:06:46] that rejects technology, and instead focusses on the power of the human mind. The author of Dune
[00:06:52] Frank Herbert was fascinated with thinking, learning, and language. How we can expand
[00:06:58] our consciousness to better see the universe – sometimes with the help of psychedelics.
[00:07:04] Characters in Dune are constantly getting high, expanding their minds and arguing about philosophy
[00:07:10] like college undergrads. So Dune is basically like Game of Thrones, in space, on drugs.
[00:07:16] And the most important drug is spice. Cause spice not only makes spaceflight possible and can give
[00:07:23] visions of the future – spice also makes people live longer, extending lifespans by decades.
[00:07:30] Many people are addicted to spice, and if they stop taking it, they’ll die. It’s an addictive,
[00:07:35] psychic, mind-expanding, life-extending, spaceship-flying drug, and it tastes like
[00:07:41] cinnamon, so naturally spice is the most valuable substance in the universe. And spice only comes
[00:07:48] from one place – the desert planet Arrakis, also called Dune. On Arrakis are giant sandworms whose
[00:07:56] life cycle makes spice. Humans harvest the spice and sell it, so whoever controls Arrakis becomes
[00:08:02] rich. The conflicts for resources in the deserts of Arrakis are comparable
[00:08:07] to conflicts for oil in the Middle East. For the last eighty years, Arrakis was ruled
[00:08:12] by the brutal House Harkonnen, led by the Baron Vladimir. The Harkonnens come from the planet
[00:08:19] Giedi Prime – “the oil-soaked, blood-soaked hell hole of the Imperium”. The movie imagines
[00:08:25] this planet as being totally industrialised – exploited and polluted until nature is gone, and
[00:08:32] smog blackens the skies. The Harkonnens exploit their people, too – they have slave labourers, sex
[00:08:39] slaves, and gladiator slaves to kill for sport. The Harkonnens use and consume everything to feed
[00:08:46] their endless appetites for power and pleasure – the Harkonnens are a mouth that swallows all.
[00:08:55] The Baron Vladimir is a ruthless political schemer, who constantly indulges his desires
[00:09:01] for food and sex. He’s too fat to support his own weight, so he uses suspensor technology
[00:09:07] which lets him levitate. To rule Arrakis, the Baron installed his nephew Rabban, who is called
[00:09:13] “the Beast” for his brutality. Rabban is not known for his intelligence – the Baron thinks of Rabban
[00:09:21] as “A muscle-minded tank-brain”. The Harkonnens are advised by Piter de Vries,
[00:09:27] a “Mentat-Assassin” who loves torture and poison. Piter is addicted to spice, and this expensive
[00:09:34] habit forces him to stay loyal to the Baron. The Baron uses peoples’ weaknesses to control them.
[00:09:41] In the movie, the Harkonnens have a freaky human-spider-thing as a “pet”, which is not
[00:09:48] in the books, but according to interviews it’s meant to be a messed-up science “experiment”,
[00:09:53] this was a human who was made into a monster. In the books there is a faction called the Tleilexu,
[00:10:00] who do weird biology experiments, so maybe they made this spider. Some fans theorise that
[00:10:06] this spider is Yueh’s captive wife Wanna, made into a monster to torture her. But that’s just
[00:10:13] horrifying speculation and is not in the books. Point is, the Harkonnens are dicks and the spice
[00:10:19] on Arrakis made them rich. But at the start of the story, the Emperor orders the Harkonnens to leave,
[00:10:25] and he gives control of the planet to House Atreides, led by Duke Leto. The Atreides have
[00:10:30] a reputation for honour and integrity. They protect their people and inspire loyalty in
[00:10:37] return. The Atreides are descended from Atreus and Agamemnon of ancient Greece.
[00:10:43] And they rule the planet Caladan – a world of oceans and jungles, farming and fishing.
[00:10:49] The Atreides aren’t very rich, but Leto is popular and influential among the houses of the Landsraad.
[00:10:55] And the Emperor hates that – he sees Leto’s popularity as a threat. So when Shaddam gives
[00:11:01] them Arrakis, that seems like a good thing for the Atreides. But really, Arrakis is a trap – the
[00:11:07] Emperor and the Harkonnens secretly plan to destroy the Atreides – with an army of Sardaukar.
[00:11:14] Sardaukar are the Emperor’s elite soldiers. Renowned for being brutal and merciless,
[00:11:20] they’re said to be the deadliest soldiers in the universe. The Sardaukar come from Salusa Secundus,
[00:11:26] a prison planet for the worst criminals in the universe. Salusa is a “hell world” where
[00:11:32] only the strongest survive – and it’s this harsh environment that makes the Sardaukar so powerful.
[00:11:38] The Emperor doesn’t want the other houses to know that he’s attacking the Atreides,
[00:11:43] so in the book, his Sardaukar are disguised in Harkonnen uniforms.
[00:11:47] He and the Harkonnens want the Atreides to “die in the dark”.
[00:11:52] The story begins with Paul Atreides – son of the Duke Leto and Lady Jessica. Paul is just
[00:12:00] fifteen years old in the book, and as the heir to House Atreides, there’s a lot of pressure on him.
[00:12:05] He has no friends his own age because of the dangers of assassination. He’s highly trained
[00:12:11] in politics, and in combat, and in the book he’s trained as a Mentat – to have a powerful
[00:12:17] logical mind like Thufir. Jessica trains Paul in the way of the Bene Gesserit, to focus his mind
[00:12:24] and body, his perception and memory, and to use the power of the Voice to control people.
[00:12:33] It might seem unrealistic to control someone with your Voice. But author Frank Herbert
[00:12:39] said we do it “all the time” – like, it’s easy to make someone angry with an insult,
[00:12:44] or happy with a compliment. And with practice, you can control people in more
[00:12:49] subtle and powerful ways – like politicians and advertisers do. You’ve just gotta know
[00:12:54] your audience, use the right words and tone. Like and subscribe to Alt Shift X.
[00:13:01] So Paul is young, but he’s a politician and a warrior with a powerful highly-trained mind.
[00:13:09] Leto visits the grave of his father, the Old Duke. The Old Duke used to fight bulls for sport,
[00:13:16] as a matador. Until he was killed by a bull in the ring. The Atreides family keep the head of this
[00:13:22] bull, with the Old Duke’s blood still preserved on its horns. So the bull head represents facing
[00:13:30] danger, putting yourself at risk. Just like Leto is putting himself in danger by coming to Arrakis.
[00:13:36] Leto knows that the Emperor and the Harkonnens plan to attack him. But he takes the risk anyway,
[00:13:42] because he believes he can win. Leto plans to use the “desert power” of Arrakis, by making an
[00:13:48] alliance with the Fremen, the local desert people. In the book, Leto believes that the Fremen will be
[00:13:54] great soldiers specifically because they live in the harsh environment of Arrakis – just like the
[00:13:59] Sardaukar are powerful because of the harshness of Salusa Secundus. Author Frank Herbert was very
[00:14:05] interested in how environments affect people, and how people affect their environment.
[00:14:11] So Leto bets everything on this plan to make the Fremen his army to beat the Sardaukar. In
[00:14:18] the movie, Paul says he doesn’t want to exploit or oppress the Fremen like the Harkonnens did.
[00:14:23] But in the book, the Atreides don’t care about the Fremen like that – their goal is to exploit them.
[00:14:30] The Atreides may seem like heroic good guys, like House Stark in space, but throughout
[00:14:36] the book they use immoral manipulative strategies, and we’re invited to question
[00:14:41] their morality. In the movie, Chani asks “who will our next oppressors be?”
[00:14:48] In the movie, Paul complains that he doesn’t get to take risks and have adventures. He questions
[00:14:53] whether he even wants to be a duke and to lead the Atreides. Leto is understanding, and says he loves
[00:15:00] Paul no matter what. It’s a touching moment of unconditional love between father and son.
[00:15:06] But in the book, we don’t see this kind of softness. The Atreides are more formal and distant
[00:15:13] and serious, book-Paul does not question his duty to their house. The Atreides in the book are an
[00:15:20] ancient dynasty in a deadly planetary conflict, and they are not fucking around. While the movie
[00:15:27] humanises the Atreides, and makes them feel more like a normal relatable family, showing affection,
[00:15:32] having breakfast, practicing mind control. The Atreides get a visit from Gaius
[00:15:35] Helen Mohiam. Gaius is a Reverend Mother, a special high-ranking Bene Gesserit who has
[00:15:41] expanded her mind using drugs. Reverend Mothers have access to the memories of their ancestors
[00:15:48] and of other Reverend Mothers. Gaius was Jessica’s teacher back at the Bene Gesserit school. And now
[00:15:54] she’s the personal Truthsayer of the Emperor – he uses her for her ability to detect
[00:16:00] lies. So Gaius is a powerful, important person and she has complicated loyalties to the Emperor
[00:16:08] and to Jessica and to the Bene Gesserit. Gaius gives Paul a test. Paul puts his hand in
[00:16:15] a box that causes terrible pain – but if he moves his hand, Gaius will kill him with a needle called
[00:16:21] the gom jabbar. So this is a test of self-control. Someone without self-control, like an animal, will
[00:16:28] instinctively move away from the pain and will die. To survive, you have to withstand the pain,
[00:16:34] control your body and mind, master your fear and your instincts. The Bene Gesserit believe that
[00:16:41] this ability to act consciously, and choose, to think long-term not just in the moment, is what
[00:16:48] separates humans from animals. They give this test to everyone they train, so that only responsible
[00:16:55] conscious humans gain the power of the Bene Gesserit. Anyone who fails this test, they kill.
[00:17:01] Before the test, we see the Atreides bull head – cause like the Old Duke
[00:17:06] with the bull, and Leto with Arrakis, Paul faces deadly danger in this test.
[00:17:12] When Jessica was trained as a Bene Gesserit, she took this test too. So she knows the pain
[00:17:18] Paul is feeling and is terrified he might die. To calm herself, she recites the Litany Against
[00:17:24] Fear – “Fear is the mind-killer”, but the fear will pass through me and I will remain.
[00:17:30] The Bene Gesserit train to calm their emotions and focus their mind. And Jessica’s training
[00:17:36] helps Paul pass this test. Paul is “human”, he has self-control, so he withstands the pain
[00:17:43] and lives. In the movie, he also has fiery visions of the upcoming Harkonnen attack.
[00:17:50] Then we learn about the Bene Gesserits’ secret plan. For thousands of years,
[00:17:55] the Bene Gesserit have manipulated the genetic lines of noble families like the Atreides.
[00:18:01] They breed certain people with other people, often by marriage to Bene Gesserits like Jessica.
[00:18:07] Even the Emperor has a Bene Gesserit wife controlling his reproduction.
[00:18:12] They select and combine certain genes, trying to produce a superhuman called the Kwisatz Haderach.
[00:18:20] This chosen one will be able see into the future and past better than any Bene Gesserit.
[00:18:26] Cause Reverend Mothers like Gaius can only access the memories of their female ancestors.
[00:18:32] The Kwisatz Haderach will access all memories. He’ll be a male Reverend Mother whose powerful
[00:18:38] mind will guide humanity. The name Kwisatz Haderach is borrowed from a real Hebrew term
[00:18:45] meaning to “shorten the way” between two places. So the Bene Gesserit want to create the Chosen
[00:18:52] One. But Jessica has messed with their plan. Cause the Bene Gesserit wanted
[00:18:56] Jessica to have a daughter, not a son. That daughter was gonna marry a Harkonnen, and
[00:19:02] their child would’ve been the Kwisatz Haderach. But Jessica, with her Bene Gesserit body control,
[00:19:08] chose to have a son, Paul, instead, because Leto wanted a son and Jessica wanted to make him happy.
[00:19:15] She chose her family over her duty to the Bene Gesserit. Jessica hopes that Paul will
[00:19:21] be the Kwisatz Haderach instead, but Gaius is doubtful – their ancient plan is now uncertain.
[00:19:29] So Paul might be the Chosen One, and he’s.. not happy about it. It feels weird and gross
[00:19:36] that he’s the product of the Bene Gesserit’s human breeding program, their manipulative eugenic plan.
[00:19:44] In the book he feels an “offense” against his “instinct for rightness”. He questions Gaius,
[00:19:50] thinks she’s a “fatuous old witch” full of meaningless “platitudes”. In other sci fi stories,
[00:19:56] the hero’s magical mentors are good and wise and pure like Obi-Wan and Gandalf the White. But
[00:20:03] Gaius is a creepy witch in a black robe who works for the Emperor who’s trying to kill Paul’s dad.
[00:20:10] The Bene Gesserit are a shadowy political cult. And their plan to artificially create the chosen
[00:20:17] one seems sinister and dark. In the book, Paul feels that he is “infected” with a “terrible
[00:20:24] purpose” that he doesn’t understand. So what is Paul’s destiny, and it really a good thing?
[00:20:31] Dune is about questioning the whole idea of heroes, religions, politicians, predictions
[00:20:38] and plans. It’s about the danger of anything that reduces our ability to think for ourselves.
[00:20:46] One of Paul’s teachers is Gurney Halleck. Gurney is a legendary fighter, like one of
[00:20:53] the best in the universe. He’s also a musician and a poet – a “minstrel-warrior” who plays an
[00:21:00] instrument called a baliset. They did film a baliset scene for the movie, but it was cut.
[00:21:06] In the book, Gurney often sings, and quotes poetry and wise scripture and dirty lyrics. His charming
[00:21:13] words and music help the Atreides win allies and influence people. Gurney is described as an “ugly
[00:21:20] lump of a man”. He's got a big red scar across his face – and a burning hatred for the Harkonnens.
[00:21:28] Cause in the book, Gurney was once a slave of the Harkonnens. The Beast Rabban killed
[00:21:33] Gurney’s family, and gave him his scar – so Gurney wants revenge. Gurney says in
[00:21:39] the movie that the Harkonnens are so brutal that they’re “not human”. The Harkonnens are
[00:21:44] often described as animals or beasts ruled by their impulses – which contrasts with
[00:21:50] the idea of humans with conscious self-control. Paul and Gurney train at fighting using shields.
[00:21:56] Shields are force fields that can stop any fast-moving object, but a slow blade can get
[00:22:04] through. Guns and explosives are useless against shields, so that’s why soldiers
[00:22:09] in Dune fight with swords and knives instead. The trick to shield fighting is to out-smart,
[00:22:15] out-manoeuvre, and distract your opponent so you can kill with a sneaky slow attack.
[00:22:21] So like everything in Dune, even the sword fights are smart and strategic, like a chess game.
[00:22:27] Paul says that he’s not in the mood for fighting, but Gurney says you must always be ready,
[00:22:33] no matter how you feel. So just like with the gom jabbar test, this is about
[00:22:38] self-control. To survive the deadly blade, you must master your emotions, your body
[00:22:44] and mind. In the book, Gurney fights Paul so aggressively that for a moment Paul thinks he
[00:22:45] might be really be trying to kill him. Gurney is warning Paul to be ready for anything on Arrakis].
[00:22:46] One of Paul’s other teachers is Duncan Idaho, who is also a legendary fighter. He’s a “Swordmaster
[00:22:53] of the Ginaz”, a “military genius”, he’s super hot, and is fiercely loyal to the Atreides.
[00:23:00] Duncan is a close friend to Paul, almost like a big brother. In the movie, Paul tells Duncan
[00:23:06] about the dreams he’s been having of the future – of this Fremen girl Chani, and of Duncan dying
[00:23:12] on Arrakis. These prescient visions are part of Paul’s power as the potential Kwisatz Haderach.
[00:23:19] In the movie, Duncan tells Paul not to focus too much on dreams – he says “everything important
[00:23:25] happens when we're awake”. Cause Dune is about the power of thoughts and visions, but it also warns
[00:23:32] us not to get too sucked in to our own minds, our assumptions and plans. “the mystery of life isn’t
[00:23:39] a problem to solve, but a reality to experience” – the deepest truths, and the joy and meaning in
[00:23:47] life, come from living in the present. Before he leaves his homeworld,
[00:23:53] Paul walks a Caladan beach. Caladan is a planet of water to contrast the harsh dry deserts
[00:24:01] of Arrakis. Caladan is beautiful, plentiful, a “paradise”. But the book says that the comforts
[00:24:07] of Caladan made the Atreides go soft. Life was too easy, they got undisciplined. Dune
[00:24:14] says that people need adversity and hard times in order to grow and achieve our potential.
[00:24:20] And Arrakis is the ultimate challenge. It’s a test, like the gom jabbar, like the bull. Now Paul
[00:24:28] goes “into the fire”. Will Arrakis forge him stronger, like the Fremen? Or will Paul burn?
[00:24:36] The Atreides arrive on Arrakis, and this guy blasts a bagpipe solo.
[00:24:43] When the people of Arrakis see Paul and Jessica, they shout “Lisan al-Gaib”,
[00:24:48] which means “the Voice from the Outer World”. Because there’s a prophecy on Arrakis that
[00:24:54] there will come a leader, the child of a Bene Gesserit, who will lead Arrakis to freedom.
[00:25:00] Paul and Jessica seem to fit this prophecy. But thing is, this prophecy is a lie – it was
[00:25:07] made up by the Bene Gesserit. The Bene Gesserit have a whole system called the Missionaria
[00:25:13] Protectiva – for thousands of years, they have spread specific religious ideas or “infectious
[00:25:19] superstitions” all over the universe. Particular signs and sayings are planted in local cultures,
[00:25:26] so if a Bene Gesserit is ever on one of these planets, they can use those signs and sayings
[00:25:31] to gain power over people – by fulfilling the prophecies that they invented. Dune author Frank
[00:25:34] Herbert said this was inspired by missionaries in the real world, who use religion to manipulate
[00:25:39] and exploit other cultures. So the people of Arrakis hope that Paul and Jessica are the
[00:25:45] chosen ones who will free them. But really, the Lisan al-Gaib prophecy is a cynical tool
[00:25:51] used by the Bene Gesserit to control people. The Atreides move into their new home in the
[00:25:58] city of Arrakeen. And Jessica hires a Fremen woman called Mapes to be a housekeeper.
[00:26:04] Not all the people of Arrakis are Fremen. Like, the people of the cities and villages
[00:26:09] aren’t Fremen. The Fremen are their own specific culture who live out in the desert – a “renegade”
[00:26:15] “will-o’-the-sand” people who live outside the control of the Imperium. Fremen all have blue
[00:26:21] eyes because their environment is saturated with spice – and spice is coloured blue in the books.
[00:26:28] Fremen have a reputation for being “fierce” and “dangerous” – “They compose poems to
[00:26:34] their knives”. The Harkonnens and the Emperor see the Fremen as “scum” and “barbarians” who
[00:26:40] “aren’t worth considering”. They think there are only a few thousand Fremen living on the
[00:26:45] edge of the desert. But the Atreides think there could be lots more Fremen,
[00:26:50] and that they could be more powerful than they seem. So the Fremen are mystery at the start of
[00:26:56] the book, and we gradually learn more about them. Mapes has the honorary title Shadout, which means
[00:27:03] “well-dipper” – cause water is super important in the Fremen desert culture.
[00:27:08] And Mapes isn’t just here for a job interview. She came to test Jessica, to see if she really fits
[00:27:15] the prophecy of the Lisan al-Gaib. So Mapes shows Jessica a crysknife, a blade made from the tooth
[00:27:22] of a sandworm. And she asks Jessica what is the meaning of the knife. Jessica says it’s a “maker”,
[00:27:29] and Mapes gets all excited, because the Fremen call sandworms “makers”. So this
[00:27:35] shows that Jessica must know the secrets of Fremen religion – she and Paul must be the Lisan al-Gaib.
[00:27:41] But thing is, in the book, Jessica is bullshitting Mapes. Jessica doesn’t know the religious meaning
[00:27:48] of the crysknife. She was gonna say that the knife is a “maker of death”, to mean it’s, just,
[00:27:54] a weapon, but Mapes interrupted Jessica once she heard what she wanted to hear.
[00:27:59] Jessica then plays along and acts like she knows this Fremen religious stuff, using signs and
[00:28:05] sayings from the Missionaria Protectiva, but inside Jessica knows this is a “sham”. Jessica
[00:28:12] exploits Mapes’ religion to manipulate her and win her loyalty. Dune is about the danger of religion,
[00:28:20] how it can warp our thinking and control us. But this isn’t just about the Atreides using
[00:28:27] the Fremen. In the book, after Jessica leaves, Mapes says to herself that Jessica is “the One”,
[00:28:33] “Poor thing”. Mapes pities Jessica, and knows things about her future. It’s hinted that
[00:28:40] just as the Atreides use the Fremen, the Fremen may be using the Atreides for their own goals.
[00:28:47] Paul is attacked by a hunter-seeker – a weapon of assassination. It’s like a flying remote-control
[00:28:55] needle – a “ravening sliver of metal” that can burrow into flesh to strike the heart.
[00:29:01] The hunter-seeker is controlled remotely by a Harkonnen assassin. The camera on the seeker is
[00:29:06] bad, so it relies on motion to find its target. So to survive, Paul has to stand perfectly still
[00:29:13] while the deadly needle points at his face. So this is just like the gom jabbar test – Paul
[00:29:20] faces a deadly needle, and to survive he has to stay still, mastering his fear and his body.
[00:29:27] Meanwhile, in the book, Jessica explores her new home and she finds a mysterious door locked with
[00:29:33] a palm reader – which is a lock that only opens to the shape of a particular person’s hand.
[00:29:39] So Jessica picks the lock by subtly changing the shape of her own palm
[00:29:44] using her Bene Gesserit muscle control. In other sci fi stories, characters might use
[00:29:49] hacking or magic or raw strength to break a lock. But Dune is about the power of the mind,
[00:29:56] so that’s how Jessica opens the door. Inside, Jessica finds a conservatory.
[00:30:01] A place full of lush plants and water on this dry desert world. It’s beautiful, but it’s a
[00:30:08] terrible waste. This much water could sustain a thousand lives on Arrakis, but instead it’s
[00:30:14] used for the pleasure of the rich and powerful. In the movie, there’s a scene with these palm
[00:30:20] trees, which are also a waste of precious water. The gardener says that the waste is okay because
[00:30:26] these trees are “sacred”. But in the book, these trees aren’t sacred. The people of Arrakis look on
[00:30:32] the trees with “envy” and “hate” for the waste of water. The trees represent inequality in the book.
[00:30:36] But the movie takes away that moral complication, and instead emphasises the mystical connection
[00:30:41] between Arrakis’ people and its environment. Anyway in the conservatory, Jessica finds a
[00:30:47] hidden message from another Bene Gesserit. A message so secret it’s written on a leaf in
[00:30:53] braille. And it warns her that there’s a traitor among the Atreides, working for the Harkonnens.
[00:31:00] In the book, Thufir also gets a message warning of the traitor. This message was planted by the
[00:31:06] Harkonnens, and they deliberately trick Thufir into thinking that Jessica is the traitor. The
[00:31:11] Harkonnens divide the Atreides, turn them against each other, to distract from the real traitor,
[00:31:18] Doctor Yueh, who is working for the Harkonnens. When Thufir tells Leto, Leto doesn’t believe
[00:31:25] that his beloved Jessica is plotting against him. But he decides to pretend that he thinks Jessica
[00:31:31] is the traitor, to make the Harkonnens think they tricked him, while he looks for the real traitor.
[00:31:37] So the plot quickly gets complicated in the book. Dune is full of these “plans within
[00:31:43] plans” and “plots within plots”. The story is a chess game where only the best minds survive.
[00:31:49] And there’s a sense from the start of the book that Leto is doomed to fail. That
[00:31:54] he’s “a man snared by Destiny”, caught in an inescapable trap. Leto has “death thoughts”,
[00:32:01] thinking about how he’ll die. And Paul is shocked to see this vulnerability in his father.
[00:32:07] Paul sees that Leto makes mistakes, and he realises that his dad won’t be around forever.
[00:32:13] Part of Paul growing up and becoming a man is seeing the flaws and the mortality in his father.
[00:32:20] The Atreides takeover of Arrakis doesn’t go well. The Harkonnens left behind broken equipment,
[00:32:26] so the Atreides can’t harvest much spice yet. And they’re still expecting an
[00:32:30] attack from the Emperor’s Sardaukar and the Harkonnens. Leto’s great hope is the Fremen.
[00:32:37] Leto sent Duncan to try to make an alliance with the Fremen. Originally, the Dune movie started
[00:32:42] with a scene of Duncan landing on Arrakis. So Duncan meets the Fremen, and he learns that Fremen
[00:32:48] live in caves called sietches. There are millions of Fremen living deep in the desert, way more than
[00:32:54] the Harkonnens and Emperor realise. The Fremen are also technologically advanced – manufacturing
[00:33:00] devices to help them survive in the desert. Duncan also learns the Fremen are deadly in combat.
[00:33:07] So the Harkonnens and the Emperor are too arrogant and prejudiced to see the potential of the Fremen.
[00:33:13] But the Atreides are open-minded and willing to learn, which opens up new possibilities.
[00:33:20] So the Atreides meet Stilgar, the leader of a Fremen sietch.
[00:33:24] The book emphasises Stilgar’s “aura of power”, and his commanding voice – he’s an impressive figure.
[00:33:31] Unlike the arrogant Harkonnens, Leto shows respect for Stilgar and his people. So Stilgar
[00:33:37] shows respect for Leto by spitting on the table – because in Fremen desert culture, giving moisture
[00:33:44] from the body is a sign of respect. Fremen culture is shaped by their dry desert environment.
[00:33:47] In the book, Duncan helped the Fremen fight some Harkonnens. So Stilgar invites Duncan to join his
[00:33:53] Fremen while also serving Leto – representing an alliance between Stilgar and the Atreides. Stilgar
[00:34:00] gives Duncan a crysknife, the sacred maker’s blade, and it’s mentioned that the Harkonnens
[00:34:06] are offering a huge bounty to anyone who can bring them a crysknife. Because anyone who has
[00:34:11] a crysknife and has spice-blue eyes would appear to be a Fremen – they could infiltrate any sietch.
[00:34:19] And in the book, the Harkonnen Mentat-Assassin Piter has blue eyes because of his spice
[00:34:24] addiction. So it seems that the Harkonnens want a crysknife so that Piter can infiltrate the Fremen,
[00:34:30] so that he can kill the Atreides if the Atreides hide with the Fremen. So this is another
[00:34:36] deadly subplot hidden within the story. But the meeting with Stilgar goes well,
[00:34:41] so there’s hope for a larger alliance between the Atreides and the Fremen.
[00:34:46] The Atreides meet Liet-Kynes. Kynes is an ecologist, or planetologist, working for the
[00:34:52] Emperor to study the environment of Arrakis. She’s also the Judge of the Change – meaning
[00:34:58] it’s her job to make sure everyone follows the rules when the Harkonnens leave Arrakis and the
[00:35:03] Atreides take over. But secretly, the Emperor has ordered Kynes to help betray the Atreides,
[00:35:08] and to let the Harkonnens attack them. But Kynes’ loyalties are even more complicated than that.
[00:35:14] In the book, Liet-Kynes is a man. Kynes’ father was Pardot Kynes, the previous Imperial ecologist.
[00:35:22] And Liet-Kynes’s mother was a Fremen woman. So Liet-Kynes was raised as a Fremen on Arrakis.
[00:35:28] Liet-Kynes married a Fremen, and they had a child called Chani. Chani is Kynes’ daughter
[00:35:35] in the movie as well as in the book. So Kynes works for the Emperor, but Kynes is really loyal
[00:35:41] to the Fremen. Kynes leads the Fremen under the name Liet. In the book, “Liet” and “Kynes” seem
[00:35:48] to be two different people at first. The Atreides think the mysterious Liet might be the name of a
[00:35:55] Fremen god. It’s only later that we find out that Liet the Fremen leader and Kynes the planetologist
[00:36:02] are the same person. So there are two sides to Kynes’ identity – Imperial, and Fremen.
[00:36:08] Outsider, and native. Scientist, and leader. Kynes gives the Atreides stillsuits. Stillsuits
[00:36:16] are special outfits for the desert that cool the body and stop it from losing moisture. All of
[00:36:21] your sweat, pee and poop, is captured by the suit and reprocessed back into drinking water. Cause
[00:36:27] without a stillsuit, in the desert’s heat, you’ll soon lose your moisture and die. The book goes
[00:36:33] into lots of detail on the different technologies people use to adapt to Arrakis’ environment.
[00:36:39] Kynes shows the Atreides how to wear their stillsuits properly – it’s a difficult, technical
[00:36:44] thing for someone who’s never used one before. But Paul somehow already knows how to wear a stillsuit
[00:36:50] properly. And that shocks Kynes, because it fits part of the prophecy of the Lisan al-Gaib – “He
[00:36:56] shall know your ways as though born to them”. Paul’s personality and his words also fit the
[00:37:04] prophecy. In the book, Kynes thinks of himself as a rational sceptical scientist who doesn’t
[00:37:10] believe in superstitions. But Paul does fit the prophecy. So it seems like there might be some
[00:37:16] truth in the prophecy of the Lisan al-Gaib mixed in with the Bene Gesserit’s lies and manipulation.
[00:37:21] The Atreides fly out to the desert to learn about spice harvesting. These flying machines
[00:37:26] are called ornithopters, which is a real word for flying machines with flapping wings.
[00:37:32] The book describes ’thopters as looking like birds with feathered wings.
[00:37:36] Harvester machines extract spice from the sand using centrifuges. In the book,
[00:37:42] they look like giant beetles with snouts and leglike tracks. The movie uses a simple industrial
[00:37:49] look for its technology, but the books have a more fantastical and colourful 60s scifi vibe.
[00:37:56] The vibrations from spice harvesting always attract sandworms. So when a worm comes,
[00:38:00] harvesters are flown to safety by a carry-all. But this time, the carry-all breaks. In the book,
[00:38:06] it doesn’t turn up at all because of Harkonnen sabotage. So Duke Leto heroically risks his life
[00:38:13] to save the workers from the sandworm. This shows that Leto genuinely cares about protecting people.
[00:38:20] Human life matters more to him than money, and that’s what makes him different to the Harkonnens.
[00:38:25] But Leto isn’t totally selfless – he is a politician. So in the book, he and Gurney
[00:38:32] give the workers a bonus payment, and he says it’s for “public relations”, to make people like Leto.
[00:38:38] Kynes points out that Leto floods Arrakis with propaganda, telling people to “Love the good
[00:38:44] Duke”. And Leto admits that his propaganda is a big part of why his men are so loyal.
[00:38:50] His image as a heroic leader is partly an act, a “mask” for political advantage. So the Atreides do
[00:39:00] show some real heroism, but that image is partly a cynical tool that they use to control people.
[00:39:08] In the book, the Atreides host a dinner party with important people on Arrakis – businessmen,
[00:39:13] politicians, smugglers – it gives the sense of a larger world on Arrakis – this is a planet,
[00:39:20] with lots of different players with their own plans and motivations.
[00:39:24] When the Harkonnens were in charge here, they had a custom where they’d deliberately waste water,
[00:39:29] dumping it onto towels on the ground, then allowing poor people to beg for drops of moisture.
[00:39:35] It was cruel, and demeaning. So Leto stops this custom and gives beggars water instead.
[00:39:42] And Jessica declares that the conservatory, that wastes so much water, will now be held
[00:39:47] in trust for all the people of Arrakis. So again, the Atreides do good for people, with gestures of
[00:39:53] respect and generosity. Leto says he’s gonna change things on Arrakis. Butdoes he really
[00:40:01] make any meaningful changes? Like sure, he gives water to a few beggars, but he does nothing change
[00:40:07] this fundamentally unfair feudal political system. Right after banning the water custom,
[00:40:12] Leto just does a different water-wasting ritual instead. So maybe these gestures are just more
[00:40:19] propaganda to make the Atreides look good. Dune is critical of politicians who appear
[00:40:25] liberal and progressive, but are really just aristocrats protecting their own power. Author
[00:40:31] Frank Herbert said the Atreides are “admirable”, but they act “with the same arrogance toward
[00:40:37] "common folk" as do their enemies”. While the Atreides act honest and
[00:40:42] honourable in public, they do some sneaky bullshit on the downlow. Like, the Atreides
[00:40:48] forge signatures to take property and evict the families of people who worked for the Harkonnens.
[00:40:53] The Atreides use Thufir, who is a “Master of Assassins” whose ruthless methods bring “death
[00:41:00] and deceit” wherever he goes. And Leto’s whole plan here is to “exploit” the Fremen as his army
[00:41:07] and exploit the land for spice. Leto says that he makes moral compromises for political gain.
[00:41:14] He says the honourable Atreides banner “could come to mean many evil things”.
[00:41:20] So the Atreides are more moral than the brutal Harkonnens. But their power is
[00:41:25] still fundamentally based on coercion and force. Like, this dinner party is fancy and glamourous,
[00:41:32] but it’s also very tense – people are nervous about getting poisoned – so inside a chandelier,
[00:41:38] there’s a hidden snooper device to detect poison. The Atreides use secret hand signals
[00:41:44] to ready their soldiers during dinner. This shows the fakeness of political power.
[00:41:50] Behind the formality and glamour there is always the deadly threat of violence.
[00:41:56] Some of the most powerful people at the party are the those who control water on Arrakis. Cause
[00:42:02] everyone needs water to live, and on this planet there’s barely any of it. Paul has to explain to
[00:42:08] someone what drowning is, and what boats are – cause there’s isn’t enough water on Arrakis for
[00:42:13] anyone to ever drown or use a boat. So alongside spice, water is a precious resource here. Author
[00:42:21] Frank Herbert said the value of water on Arrakis is equivalent to oil. And the way this natural
[00:42:27] resource shapes politics and culture shows the overarching, constant importance of the
[00:42:32] environment. No one is completely separated from natural forces like water scarcity. Not the poor
[00:42:39] begging for drops of moisture, nor the politicians who compete to control it. One of the most
[00:42:46] important characters in Dune is the planet itself. So everyone eats, and makes small talk,
[00:42:54] and secretly plots to destroy each other. Jessica realises a Spacing Guild guy is
[00:42:59] working with the Harkonnens. We learn that the Harkonnens are smuggling lasguns to Arrakis.
[00:43:05] Women try to seduce Paul. A water-seller bickers with Kynes. We get a sense of mysterious power
[00:43:12] from Kynes, connected to Kynes’ relationship with the Fremen. The Atreides talk about changing the
[00:43:18] environment of Arrakis to give it more water and plants, and Kynes acts weird and secretive about
[00:43:24] whether this is possible. And this whole time Leto is pretending to think Jessica is a traitor,
[00:43:30] and he’s super stressed about it. So at this party, the plots thicken, the tension
[00:43:36] rises, there’s a growing sense of danger to the Atreides. All night, the bull head looms above,
[00:43:43] with Atreides blood on its horns. Later, in the book, Duncan gets
[00:43:49] drunk. He’s stressed, and homesick on this dangerous alien world. So he gets wasted,
[00:43:55] and complains, and he reveals to Jessica that Thufir thinks she’s a traitor. So Jessica finally
[00:44:02] understands why Leto has been acting weird and distant with her, pretending to suspect her.
[00:44:08] So Jessica confronts Thufir. She says she’s not a traitor, and she criticises Thufir’s Mentat logic,
[00:44:16] saying he is good at analysing the world around him, but he fails to analyse his own thoughts and
[00:44:22] feelings – she says he’s biased against her for being a Bene Gesserit, and that he’s jealous of
[00:44:27] her closeness with Leto. She brags about her power and uses her Voice on him – and Thufir
[00:44:33] is shocked to witness the true hidden power of the Bene Gesserit. Thufir gets angry too,
[00:44:35] and considers killing Jessica. This in-fighting is exactly what the Harkonnens want, and Jessica
[00:44:42] realises that. But they fail to work together because of their emotions and their differences.
[00:44:48] Jessica and Thufir are a Bene Gesserit and a Mentat – both highly trained intelligent
[00:44:54] superhumans. But no matter how smart you are, everyone has human weaknesses – pride, jealousy,
[00:45:02] anger, fear, biases. Their emotions overwhelm their rational minds. And so
[00:45:08] Jessica and Thufir fail to find the real traitor, and fail to save their family.
[00:45:15] Leto finds out about this fight between Jessica and Thufir. And he feels bad about acting
[00:45:21] suspicious of the woman he loves. He regrets that he never married Jessica. Cause technically,
[00:45:27] Jessica is Leto’s concubine, not his wife. Leto stays unmarried because it’s politically useful to
[00:45:34] seem like he’s available for a marriage alliance. But really he loves Jessica, and wouldn’t marry
[00:45:39] anyone else. Leto goes to tell Jessica the truth and to apologise about pretending to suspect
[00:45:46] her – but tragically, before he can tell her, Leto is attacked by the real traitor – Yueh.
[00:45:53] So Yueh is the doctor for the Atreides family. And in the book, the Atreides think it’s impossible
[00:45:59] for him to be a traitor – because Yueh is a Suk School doctor, with Imperial Conditioning.
[00:46:06] Imperial Conditioning is a kind of mental training that supposedly makes it impossible
[00:46:11] for a Suk doctor to kill or betray their masters. This diamond tattoo on Yueh’s forehead is the
[00:46:17] mark of a Suk doctor. But the Harkonnens broke Yueh’s conditioning – they captured Yueh’s wife,
[00:46:24] Wanna, and they tortured her, to blackmail Yueh into obeying them. So Yueh betrays the Atreides,
[00:46:30] but he does it to protect his wife. Yueh doesn’t want to hurt the Atreides – he loves them.
[00:46:37] So throughout the book, Yueh feels conflicted, guilty, and stressed keeping his secret.
[00:46:43] Yueh thinks that after betraying Leto, he’ll be remembered by history as a terrible villain.
[00:46:50] And he’s right. Each chapter of the Dune book starts with a quote or excerpt from an
[00:46:55] in-universe history book written years after the events of the story. They give us glimpses of how
[00:47:01] future historians think about these characters. And in these books, Yueh is remembered as “a name
[00:47:08] black in treachery”. “A Child’s History” says “A million deaths were not enough for Yueh!”.
[00:47:15] So this shows how history doesn’t capture the full story of peoples’ lives. Yueh is a traitor,
[00:47:22] but he’s not some one-dimensional villain – he’s a complex layered
[00:47:27] character with his own feelings and perspective. Earlier in the book, Yueh gives Paul an Orange
[00:47:33] Catholic Bible. He thinks he gives Paul the gift of religion before he betrays Paul – so,
[00:47:40] Yueh thinks, Paul will now go where Yueh cannot go – meaning that Paul will go to heaven,
[00:47:46] but Yueh thinks himself damned to hell. Yueh talks with Jessica, which is very
[00:47:52] dangerous for Yueh. Because as a Bene Gesserit, Jessica can read peoples’ feelings and detect
[00:47:58] lies. So Yueh has to carefully control his words and emotions to hide that he’s a traitor. He masks
[00:48:05] his secret by expressing his real grief for his wife Wanna. Jessica opens up too,
[00:48:12] and they really connect emotionally. So much that Yueh almost decides to tell Jessica the truth that
[00:48:18] he’s working for the Harkonnens. Jessica sees that Yueh is hiding something from her, but she
[00:48:23] decides not to investigate because Yueh is such a good friend and she feels she should trust him.
[00:48:29] So this tragic, heartfelt scene makes us feel sorry for Yueh before his betrayal.
[00:48:36] Yueh kills Mapes. He hits Leto with a paralysing dart. He gives Paul and Jessica sleeping drugs
[00:48:43] so they can be captured. And Yueh turns off the Atreides house shields, so the Harkonnens and
[00:48:49] Sardaukar can attack. But Yueh also betrays the Harkonnens. He installs a fake tooth
[00:48:56] into Leto’s mouth – a weapon filled with poison gas. He tells Leto to use it to kill the Baron,
[00:49:03] to get revenge for the torture of Wanna. So the Harkonnens and Sardaukar attack. And
[00:49:09] the Atreides are shocked by how many soldiers arrive. The Baron paid the Spacing Guild a huge
[00:49:15] amount of money for troop transport. Like, sixty years worth of Arrakis’ entire income.
[00:49:22] The Baron has been planning this for a long time, and he takes no chances to crush the Atreides.
[00:49:29] In the movie, the Harkonnens use these “slow bombs” which decelerate so they can penetrate
[00:49:34] shields. While in the book, the Harkonnens use old-fashioned explosive artillery against Atreides
[00:49:40] men hiding in caves – it’s a surprise secret weapon to use such ancient technology. They
[00:49:48] kill or scatter all Atreides on the planet, and stamp out resistance by “cutting up the
[00:49:54] desert” with lasguns. The Harkonnens want “total extermination” of the Atreides.
[00:50:00] In the book, there’s a scene where the Baron and Piter have Jessica captive. The Baron had promised
[00:50:06] to give Jessica to Piter as his prisoner or slave – which is terrifying, because Piter is a sadistic
[00:50:13] torturer and killer. Piter is “a twisted Mentat” – the Baron and the Tleilaxu have corrupted him,
[00:50:21] made him “an animal” with violent selfish desires, which makes Piter a less rational, less effective
[00:50:28] thinker. Like, the Baron convinces Piter not to take Jessica, and instead promises him control
[00:50:35] of Arrakis – and Jessica sees that the Baron is lying and manipulating Piter, but with his twisted
[00:50:41] Mentat mind, Piter doesn’t see this. And the Baron fails to see how dangerous Piter is to him.
[00:50:49] So the Baron and Piter are both smart, dangerous people, and this is their moment of victory. But
[00:50:56] Jessica sees that they’re kind of incompetent. The Harkonnens’ minds are clouded and distracted
[00:51:02] by their emotions and arrogance and greed. They’re not focussed and disciplined like
[00:51:08] Jessica and Paul with their powerful human minds. The Baron wants Duke Leto and all his family dead.
[00:51:16] The Emperor and the Bene Gesserit are okay with Leto dying. But they don’t want Jessica and Paul
[00:51:22] killed as well. Cause Jessica and Paul are important to the Bene Gesserit breeding plan
[00:51:27] and under the rules of warfare in Dune, murdering entire noble families is.. generally frowned upon.
[00:51:34] So the Baron can’t kill Jessica and Paul directly – cause the Truthsayer Gaius could interrogate him
[00:51:41] and learn the truth. So instead, the Baron tries to kill Jessica and Paul indirectly – he suggests
[00:51:48] that Piter may choose to dump Jessica and Paul in the desert, so the desert will kill them – so then
[00:51:55] the Baron can they say truthfully that he didn’t kill Jessica and Paul. The Baron twists the truth
[00:52:02] with word trickery. Dune explores how words and language can be deceptive, and can limit our
[00:52:09] thinking. So some of the most talkative characters in Dune are the bad guys. Like, in the new movie,
[00:52:15] the Baron doesn’t say much. But in the book, the Baron never shuts up, he’s constantly indulging
[00:52:22] in theatrical, self-aggrandizing speeches. While the heroic Atreides are men of few words.
[00:52:29] In Dune, the deepest truths are not expressed with words, but must be experienced first-hand.
[00:52:37] So Paul and Jessica are sent to the desert to die. One of the guards is deaf, and Jessica is gagged,
[00:52:44] so she can’t use her Voice power to control the men. Paul is not as good at the Voice as Jessica
[00:52:50] is, but he manages to command the men to ungag Jessica, so she can use her Voice to control
[00:52:56] and kill them. In the movie, Paul does some cute footwork to trip a guy, while in the book
[00:53:01] he kicks the dude so hard his heart stops. We see Yueh’s diamond symbol here on the thopter.
[00:53:09] Because Yueh has pulled some strings to help Paul and Jessica escape. He hides a Fremen desert
[00:53:15] survival kit in the thopter. And he arranges for Duncan to find them in the desert. So Yueh
[00:53:21] is forced to betray the Atreides, but he also does everything he can to help save Paul and Jessica.
[00:53:28] Yueh faces the Baron. The deal was that Yueh would help the Baron defeat the Atreides,
[00:53:35] then the Baron would free Yueh’s wife Wanna, let him join her. But the Baron just kills Yueh,
[00:53:42] so he and Wanna can “join” each other in death – again the Baron twists the truth with
[00:53:48] word trickery. So in the movie, it seems like Yueh just failed, the Baron beat him – but in the book,
[00:53:56] it’s different. Cause Yueh never really believed that the Baron would give his wife back.
[00:54:02] He thought she was probably already dead. But he needed to know for certain that Wanna is free
[00:54:08] from her suffering. Wanna was a Bene Gesserit, and she taught Yueh some truthsense skills.
[00:54:14] So by facing the Baron in person, and reading his face, Yueh learns that yes,
[00:54:20] Wanna is definitely dead, she’s free from Harkonnen torture, and with that knowledge,
[00:54:26] Yueh can die satisfied. Yueh also succeeds in helping Paul and Jessica escape. And gives Leto
[00:54:34] the poison tooth to attack the Baron. Yueh thinks that Leto was gonna die anyway, with the Emperor
[00:54:40] and Harkonnens against him, so at least Yueh gives Leto a chance to bring the Baron down with him.
[00:54:47] So Yueh feels that he succeeded – he outsmarted the Baron and helped the Atreides – so with his
[00:54:54] final breath, he is defiant and triumphant. History remembers Yueh as an evil villain,
[00:55:01] but in a way his death is a heroic self-sacrifice – dying for his Wanna, and for the Atreides.
[00:55:09] The Baron faces Leto helpless before him. He’s wanted this for a long time. House Harkonnen
[00:55:17] and House Atreides have hated each other for ten thousand years – ever since an Atreides banished
[00:55:23] a Harkonnen for cowardice after a battle. Now the Baron can finally destroy his ancient
[00:55:29] enemies. But in the book, the Baron’s victory feels sour. He’s disturbed by Yueh’s defiance.
[00:55:36] And he finds out that Paul and Jessica have escaped. He feels frustrated and uncertain,
[00:55:42] so he seeks comfort in food. Dune is about the importance of self-control, mastering your mind
[00:55:50] and body. So the villain, the Baron, is someone who’s totally controlled by his body’s desires.
[00:55:57] The Baron constantly eats, he is “always hungry and thirsty”. He has evil sexual
[00:56:04] desires – in the book, the Baron drugs and rapes slave boys. The Baron is so ruled by
[00:56:11] his urges he can’t even control the movements of his body – the Baron’s hands are constantly
[00:56:17] touching and fiddling compulsively. The Baron is a beast full of hunger and lust, he’s the opposite
[00:56:26] of the Bene Gesserit ideal of human self-control. But while the Baron can’t control himself, he does
[00:56:33] control others. He treats people like objects to be used and exploited. He uses Yueh, he uses
[00:56:41] Rabban. He plans to kill Piter when he ‘outlives his usefulness’. He thinks of the people of
[00:56:48] Arrakis as “slaves”, no more than a “labor pool”. He thinks of his men and of his enemies as “bees”
[00:56:56] and “rabbits”, or as sheep and chickens, and of himself as a “carnivore”. The Baron reduces people
[00:57:03] to animals and objects, he dehumanises everyone around him – and that’s what makes him the
[00:57:10] ultimate evil in a story about the human spirit. In Leto’s last moments, he remembers happy
[00:57:18] days with his family on Caladan. His last thought is “The day the flesh shapes and the
[00:57:24] flesh the day shapes”, which suggests that our experiences and environment make us who we are,
[00:57:31] and that we make our experiences and our environment in return. Leto feels
[00:57:37] interconnected with the universe when he dies – there is a legend that in the instant he died,
[00:57:43] a meteor streaked through the sky on Caladan. Leto uses his poison tooth to try to kill
[00:57:50] the Baron. The gas kills Piter, but the Baron survives cause he has his shield on. In the movie,
[00:57:56] he’s still hurt by the gas, so he needs to have a medical black goo bath at a day spa to recover.
[00:58:03] The black goo isn’t in the book. But it is in the old David Lynch Dune movie, so maybe it’s
[00:58:09] a reference to that. Or it could be a reference to this shot in Apocalypse Now. Or maybe a reference
[00:58:14] to this bit in It’s Always Sunny, who knows. Paul and Jessica take shelter in a stilltent.
[00:58:21] And Paul’s consciousness expands. The effects of the spice, of his training, the shock of his
[00:58:28] father’s death, it all comes together to unlock a powerful new awareness. His mind now perceives
[00:58:35] every detail of the world around him – he processes and computes vast data – like a Mentat,
[00:58:42] but more. Paul has visions of the future not just in dreams, but in waking awareness – the veil is
[00:58:49] “ripped away to reveal naked time”. He doesn’t see just one certain future, he sees many different
[00:58:57] possibilities – branching paths ever changing and undulating like ocean waves. He doesn’t
[00:59:04] see everything, much of the future is hidden to him. But Paul sees many things, like that Jessica
[00:59:11] is pregnant, and that her daughter will be “St. Alia of the Knife”. Paul and Jessica will stay
[00:59:19] on Arrakis and their eyes will turn blue from exposure to spice. Jessica thinks Paul must be
[00:59:26] the Kwisatz Haderach of the Bene Gesserit plan. But Paul says he’s something else, “something
[00:59:32] unexpected”, “a seed” – and he again feels his sense of “terrible purpose”. Paul sees a future
[00:59:40] of religious war – of fanatical legions spreading violence across the universe in the Atreides name,
[00:59:47] with him as their messianic leader. The book calls this war a “jihad” or “crusade”, and connects it
[00:59:55] to a primordial human need to spread our genes across the universe – to evolve and diversify the
[01:00:02] species through chaos and upheaval. It's “war as a collective orgasm”. Paul wants to prevent this
[01:00:10] terrible violent future. And in the book, he’s horrified by how own mind has changed. All this
[01:00:17] knowledge and cold logic separates Paul from his emotions. His father is dead, and he wants
[01:00:24] to grieve, but he feels nothing. His transcendence takes away some of his humanity. Paul feels he’s
[01:00:32] “a monster” and “A freak”, and he blames Jessica, cause Jessica’s training is part of what caused
[01:00:38] this change in him. Jessica suddenly feels afraid of this powerful mind that she helped create.
[01:00:45] In the book, Paul considers joining the Spacing Guild, cause they would appreciate his powerful
[01:00:51] prescient mind. But he decides not to, because those guys are weird and gross. Instead, he says
[01:00:57] he and Jessica will join the Fremen, and they will call him “Muad’Dib”, “The One Who Points the Way”.
[01:01:05] Muad’Dib is the name of this kangaroo-mouse which Paul sees in the movie a couple times. The mouse
[01:01:11] is well adapted to survive in the deserts of Arrakis. And the mouse has special meaning in
[01:01:16] Fremen mythology because one of Arrakis’ two moons has markings that look like the Muad’Dib mouse.
[01:01:24] So Paul emerges from the womb of the tent reborn. He has transformed and expanded his mind. And he
[01:01:31] is no longer a child but as a man, the new Duke Atreides. Now, at last, Paul can mourn his father.
[01:01:41] Paul and Jessica meet up with Duncan, and they take refuge with Kynes. The Emperor
[01:01:46] ordered Kynes to help destroy the Atreides, so Kynes is taking a huge risk by protecting them.
[01:01:52] But Kynes saw Leto’s heroism and leadership. Kynes saw that Paul fits the Fremen prophecies.
[01:01:59] And Kynes saw that the Atreides are interested in changing Arrakis’ environment.
[01:02:05] Kynes takes the Atreides to an old ecological station – a science lab to study the environment
[01:02:11] of Arrakis. The book explains that Kynes’ father, Pardot, taught the Fremen about ecology – the
[01:02:18] systems of life, climate, water, animals. Pardot and the Fremen made a plan to transform the
[01:02:25] environment of Arrakis, to make it a green planet full of water and plants. After Pardot died,
[01:02:33] Liet-Kynes and the Fremen have continued to change Arrakis – they’ve been planting vegetation in the
[01:02:38] desert, feeding it moisture harvested from the wind, starting oases of life and water, to reshape
[01:02:46] the desert. And they’re doing this secretly. The Fremen have been bribing the Spacing Guild with
[01:02:52] spice to hide Fremen activity from satellites. Paul tells Kynes he could help transform
[01:02:59] Arrakis – if Paul becomes Emperor of the universe. With his new consciousness and confidence, Paul
[01:03:06] plans a play for the throne. If Paul can prove to other Houses of the Landsraad that the Emperor
[01:03:12] attacked the Atreides, everyone would turn against the Emperor. That’s the whole point
[01:03:17] of the Landsraad – it limits the Emperor’s power, to protect the Houses. So Paul plans to blackmail
[01:03:24] the Emperor, and marry one of the Emperor’s daughters, to take the throne himself. Then
[01:03:30] Paul could help Kynes change Arrakis. So Paul shows confidence and authority. But in the
[01:03:37] book, he also shows humility and loyalty to Kynes – he says he’d give his life for Kynes – showing
[01:03:45] that Atreides heroism that makes them compelling leaders. And so Kynes becomes loyal to Paul.
[01:03:51] Then the Sardaukar attack, coming to capture or kill the Atreides. In the movie, the Sardaukar cut
[01:03:57] through a door with a lasgun. Lasguns are powerful laser weapons, but they’re also super dangerous.
[01:04:04] Cause if a laser beam touches a shield, the shield and the lasgun explode. Like, a huge
[01:04:11] nuclear explosion, which kills the lasgun user as well as their target. Earlier in the book,
[01:04:17] Duncan leaves a shield as a trap to blow up a bunch of Sardaukar. So because of that,
[01:04:22] the Sardaukar avoid using lasguns here, cause they’re scared of hitting a shield again.
[01:04:27] To give Paul and Jessica time to escape, Duncan heroically holds off the Sardaukar
[01:04:32] and is killed. Just like in Paul’s dream earlier. So this shows that Paul’s prescient visions can
[01:04:39] come true. Will the holy war come true as well? Kynes Paul and Jessica escape through a secret
[01:04:47] exit. In the book, they go through a whole maze with lights that guide the
[01:04:52] way but then extinguish, so that the Sardaukar can’t follow them.
[01:04:56] In the movie, Kynes heads to the desert and uses a device called a thumper to attract a sandworm.
[01:05:03] With these maker hooks, Kynes plans to mount and ride a sandworm to travel, which is one of
[01:05:09] the great secrets of Fremen power. But Kynes is attacked by Sardaukar – because Kynes disobeyed
[01:05:15] the Emperor. Kynes defiantly says that her true master is Shai-Hulud – which is the Fremen
[01:05:22] religious name for the sandworms – “Old Father Eternity”. Kynes pounds the sand like a thumper,
[01:05:30] so that she and the Sardaukar are eaten by her god. It’s.. extremely badass, and demonstrates
[01:05:37] the power of the Fremen and the sandworms. But in the book, and in the old TV miniseries,
[01:05:43] Kynes’ death is very different. The Harkonnens leave Kynes to die in the desert. He becomes
[01:05:49] delirious, and has hallucinations of his father Pardot. Pardot lectures Liet-Kynes about their
[01:05:55] plan to change Arrakis, with all these endless scientific facts and theories to control the
[01:06:02] environment. But while Kynes thinks about controlling the environment, the environment
[01:06:07] is killing him – he’s burning in the sun, birds circle above to eat him. And in the end, Kynes
[01:06:15] is killed by a spiceblow – which is the explosive chemical reaction that creates spice on Arrakis.
[01:06:22] So Kynes and his father spent their lives trying to master this planet. But Kynes
[01:06:28] gets killed by the planet he tried to control. His knowledge and his science can’t save him.
[01:06:36] This shows the limits of human knowledge and plans. Environmental forces, the complex
[01:06:43] ever-changing machinations of the universe, are bigger and more chaotic than any person
[01:06:49] can control. No plan or science can tame the universe – nature always has the last word.
[01:06:59] Paul and Jessica escape by flying into a storm. Arrakis dust-storms are deadly,
[01:07:05] with winds that can “cut metal like butter” and strip flesh to bone. It should be certain death.
[01:07:12] But with Paul’s new consciousness, in the book, he can perceive the forces of
[01:07:17] the storm – the turbulence, the vortexes, all the tiny gusts and fronts. He feels all these forces,
[01:07:25] and sees the right path to fly to safety. In the movie, Paul has a vision of this Fremen
[01:07:32] man Jamis. Jamis says to understand a process, you must flow with it. This is basically Dune’s
[01:07:39] philosophy of how to think – the world is complicated, everything’s interconnected,
[01:07:45] ever changing. So you can’t just focus on one perspective or one set of data. You can’t rely
[01:07:52] on one narrow plan like Kynes did. Your thinking needs to continually evolve with the changing
[01:07:59] flow of reality. And that’s how Paul and Jessica survive the storm, by seeing and moving with its
[01:08:07] flow. Just as Jessica and Paul master their fear by allowing it to flow through them.
[01:08:13] In the movie, Paul hears the voices of Bene Gesserits telling him to “let go”,
[01:08:18] and so he lets go of the thopter controls, and loses consciousness and somehow survives,
[01:08:24] it’s like an act of faith in the movie. But the Dune book is not about faith,
[01:08:30] it’s not about losing consciousness. It’s about awareness and choice, and so that’s how
[01:08:36] Paul and Jessica fly to safety in the book. The Harkonnens think Paul and Jessica died
[01:08:42] in the storm, and that their victory is finally complete. So the Baron puts Rabban back in charge
[01:08:48] of Arrakis, and he tells him to “squeeze” – to exploit and oppress the people of Arrakis to make
[01:08:54] as much money as possible, to make back the money they spent on their attack. The “Beast” Rabban is
[01:09:01] happy to be a brutal dictator again. In the book he enthusiastically suggests exterminating every
[01:09:08] person on Arrakis, and asks which weapons he’s allowed to use on the population. The Baron just
[01:09:14] orders Rabban to kill all the Fremen. In the book, it’s the Sardaukar who do that. But in the book,
[01:09:20] Rabban says it might not be easy to kill the Fremen. In the book, we see the Fremen kick the
[01:09:26] Sardaukar’s ass a couple times, and characters are shocked by how deadly the Fremen are.
[01:09:31] But the Baron doesn’t listen, and arrogantly dismisses the Fremen as an irrelevant rabble.
[01:09:37] Rabban is afraid of the Baron – the book says the Baron usually won’t kill family members,
[01:09:43] but he does inflict “painful” punishments. So Rabban obeys.
[01:09:48] In the book, there’s a lot more going on in the Harkonnen plotline,
[01:09:52] with other important characters, which we should see in the next Dune movie.
[01:09:56] Paul and Jessica travel the desert. Living off their own water in stillsuits, they begin
[01:10:02] a true Arrakeen existence. The rhythm of the environment shapes their movements,
[01:10:08] changes when they sleep, changes how they think. They get a feel for the textures of the desert,
[01:10:15] all the different kinds of sand – pea sand, drum sand, flour and grit and dust and powder.
[01:10:22] The desert looks like an “ocean”, “full of moon-silvered waves”. Author Frank Herbert got the
[01:10:28] idea for Dune when he was researching sand dunes in Oregon. He learned that dunes move and flow
[01:10:34] like water, just slower. That began his research into environments, and history and religions and
[01:10:41] linguistics that led to Dune. Paul starts to like Arrakis.
[01:10:46] But Jessica just misses Caladan, and misses Leto. In the book, Jessica gets buried under a sand
[01:10:54] slide. So she uses her Bene Gesserit training to hold her body in a coma so she doesn’t suffocate,
[01:11:01] while Paul uses his powerful mind to figure out where she’s buried, and saves her. He does a cute
[01:11:07] chemistry experiment, mixing battery acid with spice to make a foam to hold back the sand. It’s a
[01:11:14] fun little science-fiction problem-solving scene, using Paul’s mind and simple tools to survive.
[01:11:20] To find the Fremen, Paul and Jessica have to cross an expanse of open sand. Which
[01:11:26] is super dangerous because of the deadly worms. Sandworms swim these sands like sharks in the sea.
[01:11:34] But Paul and Jessica face this danger just like the Old Duke faced the bull. Author Frank Herbert
[01:11:40] said sandworms are like the bull in the arena, or the archetypal dragon in the cave, guarding the
[01:11:46] treasure of spice – the worm is the monster that the hero must face. To avoid attracting a worm,
[01:11:54] they have to “walk without rhythm” – a sandwalk that imitates the natural sounds of the desert.
[01:12:00] In the book, they also set a thumper to distract the worms. And it turns out it’s very difficult
[01:12:06] to walk without rhythm while you can hear the rhythm of the thumper. It’s yet another test of
[01:12:13] control over the body and mind. Paul accidentally steps on drum sand, which makes louds vibrations,
[01:12:21] and it summons a worm, so they’ve gotta leg it to the safety of rock. Paul and Jessica are
[01:12:27] shocked by the size of the worm. In the book, its mouth is eighty metres or 260 feet across,
[01:12:34] with crystal teeth glimmering the moonlight, and breath that smells like cinnamon from the spice.
[01:12:40] Paul wonders about the mystery of exactly how spice and sandworms are connected.
[01:12:46] The book mentions that sandworms’ bodies create oxygen which is how the air is breathable on
[01:12:51] Arrakis without many plants making oxygen like on Earth. But they survive the worm,
[01:12:57] and then they face Stilgar and his Fremen. And we start to learn more about Fremen culture.
[01:13:03] In the book, Stilgar asks if Paul and Jessica are “jinn”, which is an Arabic word for supernatural
[01:13:10] spirits. Stilgar mentions “Istislah”, an Islamic term relating to the common good. Jessica thinks
[01:13:17] the Fremen speak “the language of Ilm and Fiqh” – which are Arabic words for knowledge and law.
[01:13:24] Cause the Fremen and their language are loosely inspired by real Arabic and Islamic cultures.
[01:13:30] Author Frank Herbert was particularly influenced by a book called The Sabres of Paradise about
[01:13:36] Muslims in the Caucasus – it describes a religious warrior people who speak a “Chakobsa” language,
[01:13:42] and fight against imperial “Padishah” invaders, who live in a “Sietch” or “tabr”. There are entire
[01:13:50] lines in Dune that are taken from this book. Frank was also inspired by Lawrence of Arabia,
[01:13:56] a Western man who joined with Bedouin desert tribes in their fight against the
[01:14:01] Ottoman Empire. Stilgar says the Fremen are “the Ichwan Bedwine”, which sounds like “Bedouin”.
[01:14:08] Frank was also inspired by the people of the Kalahari desert, and their careful use of
[01:14:13] water. As well as indigenous American groups. So many different real cultures inspired the Fremen.
[01:14:17] In-universe, the Dune book says that Fremen are descended from Sunni Muslims in
[01:14:22] Egypt – “Misr” is Arabic for Egypt, and “Nilotic al-Ourouba”, suggests the Nile and
[01:14:29] Arabia. Over thousands of years, this peoples’ religion changed into the Zensunni tradition – a
[01:14:35] combination of Zen Buddhism with Sunni Islam. The Zensunni Wanderers suffered millennia of
[01:14:42] persecution and displacement, including nine generations of slavery on Selusa Secundus.
[01:14:48] Eventually they settled on Arrakis, and developed the unique Fremen culture, adapted to life in the
[01:14:54] desert, and hardened by their suffering. Survival on Arrakis can require brutal
[01:15:01] decisions for the good of the group – so Stilgar’s Fremen threaten to kill Jessica to take her water.
[01:15:08] So Jessica uses her Bene Gesserit fighting skills to kick Stilgar’s arse. And Paul beats up the
[01:15:14] Fremen man Jamis. So Jessica proves that she has useful skills, and Stilgar agrees to keep her.
[01:15:21] In the book, he has some fun dialogue calling one of his men a “wormfaced, crawling, sand-brained
[01:15:28] piece of lizard turd!”. Stilgar is charismatic, and a powerful leader, dedicated to protecting
[01:15:35] his tribe. He’s also very intelligent, and willing to adapt to change. He asks Jessica to teach his
[01:15:43] Fremen how to fight in her “weirding way”. And the Fremen will teach Jessica and Paul to survive
[01:15:48] in the desert. It will be “a good exchange of teachings” – Dune values knowledge and learning.
[01:15:56] In the book, Jessica does more of her Missionaria Protectiva manipulations, trying to convince the
[01:16:02] Fremen that she and Paul fit the Lisan al-Gaib prophecy. Jessica brings up Sietch Tabr, Stilgar’s
[01:16:08] home, as though she has some mystical knowledge of the place – but really she just read the name on a
[01:16:14] map once – “If only he knew the tricks we use!”, she thinks. Jessica feels a “cynical bitterness”
[01:16:22] at her manipulation. But she’s determined to use the Fremen as an army to help Paul retake Arrakis.
[01:16:30] Paul meets Chani, and he’s shocked to recognise her from his visions. In the books she has
[01:16:37] an “elfin face”, a laughing voice, the grace of a gazelle, and she has “red hair”. Paul
[01:16:44] feels embarrassed that she caught him with a gun, and he immediately has a crush on her.
[01:16:50] Jamis is angry that Paul beat him up. So Jamis challenges Paul, invoking the amtal rule.
[01:16:57] Amtal means to test something until it breaks, to learn someone’s true nature by pushing them
[01:17:03] to their limits, like the gom jabbar – Jamis will fight Paul to the death. In the book,
[01:17:10] Jamis says this will test whether Paul and Jessica are the Lisan al-Gaib. He argues that
[01:17:17] Jessica might be making “a false way among us”, trying to deceive the Fremen to fit the prophecy,
[01:17:23] which.. she is. In the book, Jessica uses the Voice on Jamis, and threatens him,
[01:17:28] but the Fremen realise she’s manipulating him and order her to be silent. So Paul faces Jamis alone.
[01:17:37] Paul has seen possible futures from this moment, and in most of them, Paul dies. He
[01:17:44] is at the centre of a nexus in time, a storm of possibilities, where the slightest mistake
[01:17:50] could change the future dramatically. There are too many branching possibilities for Paul to see
[01:17:56] a clear path to victory. The only way to survive this is with his skills, his mind, and his knife.
[01:18:04] In the book, Chani gives Paul advice on how to beat Jamis,
[01:18:08] warning him about Jamis’ fighting style. But in the movie, Chani says she doesn’t believe in Paul
[01:18:14] and that he’s gonna die. Which is a fun change – making Chani more sceptical of Paul.
[01:18:20] In the movie, Chani gives Paul a crysknife – and this is the same knife that Paul kept
[01:18:25] seeing in visions. Paul saw Chani stabbing him with this knife. Will this vision come true?
[01:18:34] Paul salutes Jamis in the same way that Duncan saluted earlier – an echo of his fallen friend.
[01:18:41] And they prepare to fight. In the book,
[01:18:44] Paul and Jamis fight wearing just loincloths. But in the movie they wear their stillsuits,
[01:18:49] so we don’t get to see Timothee Chalamet in just his “fighting trunks”.
[01:18:54] In the movie, Paul hears the voices of Bene Gesserit telling him not to be afraid,
[01:18:59] not to resist, to fulfil his destiny as the Kwisatz Haderach. But in the book, Paul doesn’t
[01:19:06] rely on destiny – he focusses on his training. On the advice of Jessica, Duncan and Gurney. On his
[01:19:14] Bene Gesserit mastery of his body and mind. Paul is “a fighting machine” trained from infancy by
[01:19:21] some of the best warriors in the universe. But in the book, Paul’s training gives him
[01:19:26] a disadvantage. Cause Paul is trained for shield-fighting. He learned to attack slowly,
[01:19:32] so his blade can penetrate shields. But Jamis has no shield. The Fremen don’t use shields,
[01:19:39] because shields attract sandworms. So Paul keeps attacking Jamis too slowly. While Jamis,
[01:19:46] who isn’t trained with shields, attacks faster than Paul is used to. So Paul has
[01:19:51] to change his fighting style. Sometimes to survive, you have to unlearn old assumptions.
[01:19:58] So Paul kills Jamis, winning the respect of the Fremen. Jessica is relieved that her son
[01:20:05] survived. But in the book, she does something interesting. Jessica immediately comes up and
[01:20:10] calls Paul a killer, her voice harsh and full of scorn. She deliberately makes Paul feel bad
[01:20:18] about killing Jamis. Because Paul gets a lot of attention and validation for this victory,
[01:20:26] including from the girl of his dreams, Chani. Jessica doesn’t want Paul to learn to enjoy
[01:20:33] killing. So she applies some emotional conditioning to keep Paul’s morality in line.
[01:20:40] In the movie, there’s a sadness to Jamis’ death. Cause earlier, Paul had visions of
[01:20:46] Jamis being a “friend”, someone who taught Paul about the desert. But because of Paul’s choices,
[01:20:52] and chance – that vision didn’t come true, and Paul had to kill the man who could have been his
[01:20:57] friend. So Paul’s visions aren’t guaranteed, just possibilities. They’re like predictions, plans,
[01:21:05] hopes and fears in the real world – they can guide us to achieve our goals, but they can also
[01:21:12] limit our thinking. Dune explores the power and the danger of predictions and dreams.
[01:21:20] In the book, Paul cries for Jamis, and the Fremen see crying as a profound sacred act,
[01:21:26] because of how precious water is in the desert. Paul says that Jamis was his friend, that Jamis
[01:21:32] taught him that killing has a price. So maybe, in a way, Paul’s vision of Jamis as a friend,
[01:21:39] who taught him, did come true after all. The Fremen wrap up Jamis’ body and take it
[01:21:46] with them. Because when a Fremen dies, the water is drained from their body
[01:21:50] in a “deathstill” and reclaimed for the Fremen to use. “The flesh belongs to the person,
[01:21:56] but his water belongs to the tribe”. In the movie, Paul gives a confident
[01:22:02] heroic speech. He says he sees his future, and he chooses to be with the Fremen. It’s
[01:22:07] an uplifting and optimistic end to the movie. But at this point in the book, the vibe is darker and
[01:22:11] uncertain. Paul and Jessica are unsure about the Fremen, but feel forced to use them to survive.
[01:22:18] Paul doesn’t see his future clearly – he feels he is ‘plunged into the abyss’. He’s afraid of
[01:22:25] his visions of the bloody Jihad, and desperately hopes to prevent it. Paul’s destiny is dangerous.
[01:22:33] We see a Fremen riding a sandworm to travel – there’s much more to learn about the power of
[01:22:39] the Fremen and their desert. Chani says “This is only the beginning”, and it really is.
[01:22:46] This movie only covers the first half of the first book in the Dune trilogy.
[01:22:51] Which itself is just the beginning of a larger series. There is so much more to this story.
[01:22:58] Frank Herbert said that the first Dune book has a “coital” rhythm. Meaning the pacing of the story
[01:23:04] is like sex – it starts slow, and speeds up, then suddenly climactically ends.
[01:23:11] So by ending this movie halfway through the first book, Denis Villeneuve stops mid-coitus,
[01:23:17] leaving us with waiting, without a climax, until Dune Part Two comes out.
[01:23:23] This movie is a mostly faithful adaptation of the first half of the first book. It introduces
[01:23:29] the worlds and politics of the Imperium, the mysterious Spacing Guild, the scheming Bene
[01:23:36] Gesserit. The evil Harkonnens defeat the Atreides, Paul and Jessica escape to the Fremen, and they
[01:23:42] start to learn the ways of the desert. We see Paul’s complicated destiny and ambiguous visions,
[01:23:49] and hints of the dangers of the messiah. The movie introduces ideas of the environment and
[01:23:56] religion and political exploitation and the power of the mind. But the movie leaves out some
[01:24:03] important scenes like the dinner party, and the traitor subplot. It doesn’t capture the tragedy
[01:24:10] of Doctor Yueh, the meaning of Kynes’ death, or the darker manipulative side of Leto and Jessica.
[01:24:18] It removes some of the Arabic references from the Fremen, and it skips plotlines with the
[01:24:23] Harkonnens and with Thufir. Hopefully we’ll get this in the next Dune movie.
[01:24:29] But to understand the meaning of Paul’s story, and the message of Dune, we’ve got to talk
[01:24:34] about the other books. So we’ve got a new video called the Philosophy of Dune, coming out soon.
[01:24:41] We’ve also got a Podcast episode out now talking about Dune with Quinn, from Quinn’s Ideas.
[01:24:47] We’re also doing a Q&A livestream about Dune on this channel in 24 hours. And for some reason,
[01:24:54] professional shitposter Alt Schwift X has released a rap about Dune. So check out all
[01:25:00] that Dune content linked below. We will make more Dune videos in the future. And we’re covering more
[01:25:07] Song of Ice and Fire, and the upcoming Game of Thrones prequel TV show House of the Dragon.
[01:25:13] House of the Dragon is based on a book called Fire & Blood.

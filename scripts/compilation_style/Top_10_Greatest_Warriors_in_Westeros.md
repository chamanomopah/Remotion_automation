[00:00:01] Who are the Top 10 Greatest Warriors in A Song of Ice and Fire?
[00:00:05] Which characters are best at fighting, in their prime years, with their usual weapons
[00:00:09] and armour?
[00:00:11] This ranking is based on the books, in the time period of the main series and Robert’s
[00:00:15] Rebellion.
[00:00:16] No dragons or warging or magic allowed, giants and white walkers don’t count.
[00:00:21] The number ten best warrior is Victarion Greyjoy, “The Iron Captain”.
[00:00:26] Victarion wasn’t in the TV show.
[00:00:28] But he’s an uncle of Theon and Asha.
[00:00:31] And Victarion is renowned among the ironborn as a fearsome warrior.
[00:00:35] He’s a big man, strong as a bull and about as smart as a bull, but that just makes him
[00:00:41] braver.
[00:00:42] Victarion wears heavy plate armour even in sea battles – which is dangerous, cause
[00:00:46] he could drown if he falls overboard, but Victarion is fearless.
[00:00:51] He lives to fight, he was put on this earth to deal death with his axe.
[00:00:57] In Book 4, Victarion singlehandedly slaughters a bunch of men in battle.
[00:01:01] Then he kills a knight called Talbert Serry – Serry is fast, but Victarion’s fast
[00:01:07] too, catching Serry’s sword in his armoured hand.
[00:01:11] Victarion’s hand gets wounded and infected.
[00:01:14] So a red priest called Moqorro heals Victarion’s hand with magic, and now Vic’s arm is burned
[00:01:21] black, and smoking, and is stronger than ever.
[00:01:25] Victarion lifts a man in the air and kills him with just this bare hand.
[00:01:30] So with his new super-strong barbeque fist, Victarion may be even more dangerous than
[00:01:37] before.
[00:01:38] But we never see Victarion fight any really skilled opponents.
[00:01:43] Talbert Serry is not a particularly renowned knight.
[00:01:46] And Victarion’s bravery does border on stupidity.
[00:01:50] So while Victarion is powerful, there are better fighters.
[00:01:55] Number nine is Loras Tyrell, “the Knight of Flowers”.
[00:01:59] Loras is just sixteen years old in Book 1, but he’s already famous as a great knight.
[00:02:04] He’s graceful, and quick, and very skilled at fighting.
[00:02:09] Author George Martin said Loras is one of the best swordsmen in Westeros.
[00:02:13] And he’s extremely good at jousting in tournaments.
[00:02:16] But Oberyn Martell questions whether Loras is any good in actual battle.
[00:02:21] So what fights has Loras won?
[00:02:24] We see Loras lose a fight with Brienne in a melee.
[00:02:28] Loras kills two knights – who were on his side, out of mad grief.
[00:02:33] Loras apparently fought “magnificently” at the Battle of the Blackwater, though not
[00:02:37] as magnificently as his brother Garlan.
[00:02:41] In Book 5, Loras leads a savage assault on Dragonstone, and kills a bunch of men, but
[00:02:46] Loras gets badly wounded and doused in boiling oil, and is expected to die.
[00:02:52] So Loras is a talented fighter, but he doesn’t have many great feats of battle.
[00:02:58] And his arrogant recklessness is a weakness that may’ve just got him killed.
[00:03:02] Jaime thinks Loras has the potential to be great.
[00:03:06] But so far that potential is unfulfilled.
[00:03:10] Number eight is Brienne, the Maid of Tarth.
[00:03:13] Brienne is freakishly big and strong.
[00:03:17] She’s well over six feet tall, bigger and stronger than Jaime.
[00:03:21] She’s a skilled fighter, she moves shockingly fast in battle.
[00:03:25] And she’s even more dangerous with the Valyrian steel sword Oathkeeper.
[00:03:30] In Book 2, Brienne wins a melee at Renly’s camp – she’s the last standing of one
[00:03:35] hundred and sixteen knights, and she personally defeats Loras Tyrell, one of the best knights
[00:03:41] alive.
[00:03:42] Though Loras claims that she won with a trick, by tackling him.
[00:03:46] Brienne often uses her size and strength to overwhelm opponents – her fighting style
[00:03:51] is similar to that of her ancestor, Duncan the Tall.
[00:03:54] After Renly dies, Brienne fights off a bunch of Renly’s men, with speed and skill.
[00:04:00] In Book 3, Brienne fights Jaime Lannister, one of the best swordsmen in Westeros.
[00:04:05] It’s a long, hard fight, but try as he might, Jaime can’t kill her, and ultimately, Brienne
[00:04:11] beats Jaime.
[00:04:13] Though she realises that Jaime is weakened from months of imprisonment, and his hands
[00:04:18] are chained together, so Brienne thinks that Jaime would have won if he was at his full
[00:04:22] strength.
[00:04:23] In Book 4, Brienne fights some of the Brave Companions, or Bloody Mummers, a mercenary
[00:04:28] group of absolute frothing psychos.
[00:04:31] Brienne kills three of them in a one v three fight with a little help from Pod.
[00:04:36] And in the next fight she kills Rorge, the Mad Dog of Saltpans, but then Biter eats some
[00:04:44] of Brienne’s face, before she’s saved by Gendry.
[00:04:48] So Brienne is often underestimated for being a woman.
[00:04:51] But with her great strength, skill, and sheer tenacity, Brienne wins a lot of fights, and
[00:04:58] defeats some of the greatest knights in Westeros.
[00:05:01] Number seven is Garlan Tyrell “the Gallant”.
[00:05:05] Garlan wasn’t in the TV show.
[00:05:07] But in the books, he’s an older brother of Loras.
[00:05:10] Garlan isn’t as famous as Loras.
[00:05:12] But he is bigger and stronger.
[00:05:14] And Loras says that Garlan is a better swordsman than him.
[00:05:18] Author George Martin said the same thing.
[00:05:20] We see that Garlan often trains by fighting three or four men at once, so that he’s
[00:05:26] better prepared for real battle.
[00:05:29] Garlan fights “magnificently” at the Battle of the Blackwater – he kills Guyard Morrigen
[00:05:33] in single combat “and a dozen other great knights”.
[00:05:37] When Margaery faces a trial by combat, it’s Garlan she wants as her champion.
[00:05:42] So we haven’t seen much of Garlan.
[00:05:45] But he’s clearly an exceptional warrior.
[00:05:48] Number six is Gregor Clegane, “the Mountain That Rides”.
[00:05:53] Gregor is monstrously “huge”.
[00:05:56] Almost eight feet tall and weighing four hundred pounds, or two hundred kilos, “all of it
[00:06:01] muscle”.
[00:06:02] Gregor is inhumanly strong, he often cuts men in half with a single blow.
[00:06:08] Gregor wields a two-handed greatsword in one hand, so he’s got a monstrously long reach.
[00:06:14] He’s surprisingly quick, and he doesn’t seem to feel pain.
[00:06:18] “No other knight in the realm inspires such terror” as the Mountain.
[00:06:23] The Hound says “No one could ever withstand Gregor”.
[00:06:27] But what are his accomplishments in combat?
[00:06:30] In Book 1, the Mountain attacks Loras and the Hound, and tries to kill them, but he
[00:06:35] fails.
[00:06:36] The Hound stops the Mountain, deflects his massive blows.
[00:06:41] The Mountain fights in some battles in the war – he kills Beric Dondarrion – twice.
[00:06:46] He kills Raymun Darry and his horse with a single blow.
[00:06:50] Then in Tyrion’s trial by combat, Gregor fights Oberyn Martell.
[00:06:54] And Oberyn uses his speed and skill and poison to mortally wound Gregor, impaling him with
[00:07:00] a spear – though Gregor still kills Oberyn in the end.
[00:07:05] Then the mad scientist Qyburn transforms the Mountain into a mysterious undead warrior
[00:07:10] called Robert Strong.
[00:07:12] This silent knight may be even more dangerous than the Mountain was, but we haven’t seen
[00:07:18] yet him in action in the books.
[00:07:20] So the Mountain is extremely dangerous, but we’ve never seen him beat a really top-tier
[00:07:26] opponent.
[00:07:27] Skilled warriors like Oberyn and the Hound can stop him.
[00:07:31] So number five is the Hound, Sandor Clegane.
[00:07:35] The Hound is a big man, tall, “muscled like a bull”.
[00:07:39] And he’s “quick”, fighting with a terrible “savagery”.
[00:07:43] Sandor is a twisted, bitter man whose greatest joy in life is killing.
[00:07:48] He’s been killing men since he was twelve years old – knights, lords, women and children.
[00:07:55] Everyone knows the Hound is “deadly with a sword”, and his snarling dog helm is widely
[00:08:01] feared.
[00:08:02] Even Jaime says the Hound is a “dangerous”, “powerful” warrior.
[00:08:06] Author George Martin said the Hound is one of the greatest swordsmen in Westeros.
[00:08:10] And we’ve seen this in action.
[00:08:12] In Book 1, the Hound stops the Mountain.
[00:08:15] Despite all the Mountain’s strength and rage he can’t kill his brother.
[00:08:20] The Hound flees the Battle of the Blackwater, because he’s afraid of fire.
[00:08:24] But in Book 3, he overcomes his fear to kill Beric Dondarrion.
[00:08:28] Killing Beric is basically a Clegane family tradition.
[00:08:31] The Hound kills some men at the Twins in a three v one fight.
[00:08:36] Then with the help of Arya, he kills some of Gregor’s men, even though he’s blind
[00:08:40] drunk.
[00:08:41] The Hound’s wounds get infected, and he’s left for dead.
[00:08:45] But in Book 4, the Hound seems to have survived and found a peaceful life as a monk.
[00:08:50] Maybe he’ll return to fight his zombie brother in the next book.
[00:08:55] So the Hound has a proven record as a skilled, powerful warrior.
[00:09:00] But the fourth best warrior in Westeros is a young Robert Baratheon.
[00:09:05] In Book 1, Robert is fat, drunk, and past his prime.
[00:09:09] But twenty years ago, when he took the Throne, Robert was “the fiercest warrior of the
[00:09:14] realm”.
[00:09:15] He was six and a half feet tall, towering over his enemies in his armour and antlered
[00:09:20] helmet.
[00:09:21] He had “a giant’s strength”, wielding a huge iron warhammer that Ned Stark could
[00:09:25] barely lift.
[00:09:27] In his rebellion against the Targaryens, Robert won many battles, fighting fearlessly on the
[00:09:32] front lines.
[00:09:33] At Gulltown, he was the first up the walls and killed Lord Grafton by his own hand.
[00:09:39] At Summerhall, Robert won three battles in one day, and killed Lord Fell in single combat.
[00:09:46] He lost a battle at Ashford, but he won the Battle of the Bells and killed six men including
[00:09:51] the famous knight Myles Mooton.
[00:09:54] Finally, Robert won the Battle of the Trident, personally killing Prince Rhaegar Targaryen,
[00:10:00] who was renowned as a skilled warrior.
[00:10:02] And so Robert won the war and became King of Westeros.
[00:10:06] Robert is one of the most successful warriors ever.
[00:10:09] He won all these battles, personally killing many knights and lords, and no one ever managed
[00:10:15] to kill him.
[00:10:17] Except, eventually, for a pig, and his wife, and his crippling alcoholism.
[00:10:22] But in his prime, Robert was one of the greatest warriors in Westeros.
[00:10:28] Number three is Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer, before he lost his hand.
[00:10:34] Barristan Selmy thinks of Jaime as one of the best natural swordsmen he’s seen.
[00:10:38] Jaime says that in his prime he was bigger, stronger and quicker than Loras.
[00:10:43] He’s confident that with his skill and speed, he could beat the Mountain and the Hound.
[00:10:49] Author George Martin often names Jaime as one of, if not the, best fighters in Westeros.
[00:10:54] He said Jaime would beat Aragorn in a fight.
[00:10:57] He said Jaime would beat Hermione in a fight.
[00:11:00] He said Jaime would beat a cult of Cthulhu.
[00:11:03] Jaime won a tournament melee when he was just thirteen years old.
[00:11:08] At fifteen, he fought the Kingswood Brotherhood, and held his own against the notorious Smiling
[00:11:13] Knight.
[00:11:14] Jaime was knighted by Arthur Dayne, and became the youngest Kingsguard ever.
[00:11:18] In the main series, he kicks ass in several battles, covering himself in glory.
[00:11:24] He cuts through Edmure’s army “like an axe through ripe cheese”.
[00:11:28] At the Whispering Wood, he fights through the northern army and almost kills Robb Stark
[00:11:32] – he only stops because his sword gets stuck in a northman’s neck.
[00:11:38] Even after being imprisoned and weakened for months, he still almost beats Brienne.
[00:11:42] Brienne thinks at his full strength, “No knight in the Seven Kingdoms could have stood
[00:11:47] against him”.
[00:11:49] Once Jaime loses his hand, he’s no longer a great fighter.
[00:11:53] But his battles, his reputation, and the words of the author, show that Jaime is the greatest
[00:11:59] warrior of his generation.
[00:12:01] Number two is a young Barristan Selmy.
[00:12:04] Barristan the Bold is widely recognised as the greatest knight alive, a living legend.
[00:12:11] When he was young, Barristan “was the finest sword in the Seven Kingdoms”.
[00:12:14] And he has a long list of accomplishments in combat.
[00:12:18] Barristan rode in his first tournament at ten years old.
[00:12:22] At sixteen, he performed “great feats of prowess” in a tournament, and defeated Duncan
[00:12:26] the Tall, Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
[00:12:29] At 23, he joined the Kingsguard himself, and won many more victories in tournaments and
[00:12:34] melees.
[00:12:35] He “Defeated Lormelle Long Lance and Cedrik Storm” and Blackshield, he defeated all
[00:12:36] challengers at the Silver Bridge.
[00:12:38] Barristan defeated Simon Toyne of the Kingswood Brotherhood.
[00:12:42] Barristan ended the War of the Ninepenny Kings, by killing Maelys the Monstrous in “single
[00:12:48] combat”.
[00:12:49] And Barristan ended the Defiance of Duskendale.
[00:12:53] King Aerys Targaryen got kidnapped and held hostage by House Darklyn.
[00:12:57] So in an act of crazy courage, Barristan singlehandedly rescued the king.
[00:13:02] He climbed the walls of Duskendale with his bare hands, killed a bunch of guards and knights,
[00:13:08] and escaped with Aerys, despite taking an arrow to his chest.
[00:13:12] In the Battle of the Trident, Barristan fought for the Targaryens, but he was so badass that
[00:13:16] when Robert took over, he decided to keep Barristan on the Kingsguard.
[00:13:20] In the time of the main series, Barristan is in his sixties, and he’s still an exceptional
[00:13:25] fighter.
[00:13:26] Still winning tournaments.
[00:13:27] Still better than all the other Kingsguard.
[00:13:30] He joins Daenerys and he kills the Titan’s Bastard with a stick.
[00:13:34] He kills a deadly Dothraki warrior.
[00:13:37] And he leads a cavalry charge in the siege of Meereen.
[00:13:40] Barristan has been winning fights for six decades, and is universally recognised as
[00:13:45] the greatest knight alive.
[00:13:48] But there is one warrior who is better.
[00:13:52] First – some honourable mentions.
[00:13:53] Oberyn Martell, the Red Viper, has a great reputation as a warrior, and he’s very skilled,
[00:13:58] but the one time we see him fight, he dies.
[00:14:01] Bronn is a deadly warrior, Tyrion compares him to Jaime.
[00:14:05] Thoros of Myr beats the Hound in melees three times, probably because Thoros uses flaming
[00:14:11] swords.
[00:14:12] Khal Drogo never loses a fight but we never see him beat an armoured knight.
[00:14:19] Greatjon Umber is so tough that when his fingers get eaten he laughs.
[00:14:23] Mance Rayder became king of the wildlings by killing a bunch of his rivals.
[00:14:28] Andrik the Unsmiling is said to be greatest fighter in the Iron Islands, but we don’t
[00:14:33] know anything about him.
[00:14:34] Darkstar is said to be “the most dangerous man in Dorne” – he’s also edgiest emo
[00:14:40] in Dorne.
[00:14:41] And Strong Belwas is such a confident gladiator that he lets his opponents cut him before
[00:14:47] he kills them.
[00:14:48] He survives poison, eats liver and onions, and takes a literal shit on his opponents.
[00:14:55] The kitten Ser Pounce has the impressive combat feat of scaring off Balerion, a notably fearsome
[00:15:02] tomcat.
[00:15:03] However, Ser Pounce fails to prevent Lady Whiskers from stealing his mouse, so Ser Pounce’s
[00:15:08] combat record is mixed at best.
[00:15:11] But the number one best warrior in Westeros is Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning.
[00:15:18] Arthur died twenty years ago.
[00:15:21] But he’s remembered as the “deadliest” of Aerys’ Kingsguard – deadlier than Barristan,
[00:15:27] deadlier than Jaime.
[00:15:28] Jaime says Arthur could’ve killed five Kingsguard with his left hand while taking a piss with
[00:15:34] his right.
[00:15:35] Ned Stark said Arthur was “The finest knight” he ever saw.
[00:15:39] Arthur wielded the legendary sword Dawn, said to be forged from the heart of a meteor.
[00:15:46] George Martin said that with Dawn, Arthur would beat Barristan in a fight.
[00:15:50] Arthur killed the Smiling Knight, who was like the Mountain of his time.
[00:15:55] Arthur apparently died fighting Ned Stark, with the help of Howland Reed.
[00:16:01] In the show, it’s revealed that Howland stabbed Arthur in the back – but in the
[00:16:05] books, this whole situation is still a mystery.
[00:16:08] There’s so much we don’t know about Arthur.
[00:16:10] His only fights mentioned in the books are Ned Stark and the Smiling Knight.
[00:16:14] We only know he’s the best warrior ever because the characters and the author say
[00:16:19] so.
[00:16:20] Many characters think of Arthur with nostalgia, and rose-tinted glasses.
[00:16:26] So was he really that great, or is he just the idealised symbol of a noble knight?
[00:16:32] How can we ever know if he would’ve beaten the Hound or Brienne in a fight?
[00:16:37] George Martin has said the whole idea of ranking the best fighters is kinda dumb.
[00:16:42] There is no objective answer.
[00:16:44] Who would win in a fight depends on the situation, on the day, on random chance.
[00:16:50] It depends on the relationships and emotions of the people involved.
[00:16:54] A Song of Ice and Fire isn’t about the sword-fights – it’s about the story, the characters
[00:16:59] and themes.
[00:17:01] But we won’t let that stop us.
[00:17:03] Comment below your top ten best fighters, or top twenty – how would you rank Oberyn
[00:17:08] and the Greatjon and Belwas?
[00:17:10] We have almost finished two big videos about Dune, that will come out soon.
[00:17:15] And the Game of Thrones prequel TV show House of the Dragon will start in August, we’ll
[00:17:20] make videos about that too.
